<h2 class="nobreak">NAVAL WARFARE&mdash;OLD AND NEW</h2>


<p class="ph1">Trafalgar and Modern Fights in the North Sea</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOT the least remarkable of the changes which
have taken place during the last hundred years&mdash;it
is less than that, really&mdash;are those which have
come to pass in the sphere of warfare; and the accounts
of the battles here given show how different naval
fighting is to-day from what it was in Nelson&#8217;s time.
Then wooden ships, now steel leviathans; then guns
that fired about 800 yards, now giant weapons that
hit the mark ten miles off; then close fighting, boarding,
hand-to-hand conflicts, now long-range fighting,
with seldom, if ever, a chance to board. Then shots
that did what would be considered little damage beside
that wrought by the high-explosive shells which penetrate
thick armour-plate, and which, well-placed, can
send a ship to the bottom. Then none of those speeding
death-tubes, the torpedoes, which work such dreadful
havoc with a floating citadel; then casualties in a
whole battle no more than those suffered by a single
ship nowadays. And so one could go on, touching
on wireless telegraphy, fire-control&mdash;that ingenious
system which does man&#8217;s work of sighting the guns&mdash;aircraft
and submarines, which constitute so serious a
factor in present-day warfare. But the story of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Trafalgar, that well-fought battle against a noble foe
who is now a gallant ally, and those of the North Sea,
1914 and 1915, will show the revolutions in modern
naval warfare.</p>

<p>Nelson had determined to meet and beat Villeneuve,
in command of the allied French and Spanish fleet,
which left Cadiz at the end of September, 1805. The
French admiral did not know how near Nelson was.
To-day the means of communication are vastly
different, and battleships are able to discover the
proximity of their foes much more easily than in those
other days. It is one of the great changes in naval
warfare. So it was that the allied fleets were dogged
until Nelson decided it was time to strike.</p>

<p>On the 21st the rival fleets met. The English fleet
was in order of battle&mdash;two lines, with an advanced
squadron of eight fast-sailing two-deckers. Nelson,
in the <i>Victory</i>, led one column, Collingwood, in the
<i>Royal Sovereign</i>, the other.</p>

<p>About half-past eight Villeneuve ordered his fleet to
draw up in such array and position that, if necessary,
they could make for Cadiz; but the man&#339;uvre was badly
executed, and the fleet assumed a crescent-shaped formation,
into which the English columns were sailing.</p>

<p>Nelson was longing for the fight; so were his men.
But, although the officers on board the <i>Victory</i> were
eager for the fight, they would have been content to
forgo the honour of opening the fight in favour of
some other ship, fearing lest Nelson should be killed.</p>

<p>Nelson was asked: &#8220;Could not the <i>Temeraire</i> take
the foremost place of the column?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nelson replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, let her go&mdash;if she can!&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Hardy hailed the <i>Temeraire</i> to give her
instructions; but, meanwhile, Nelson was moving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
about the decks giving orders that made the <i>Victory</i>
leap forward and hold her place in the vanguard.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said to Hardy, as he came back. &#8220;Let
the <i>Temeraires</i> open the ball, if they can&mdash;which they
most assuredly can&#8217;t! I think there&#8217;s nothing more
to be done now, is there, till we open fire? Oh, yes,
stay a minute, though. I suppose I must give the fleet
something as a final fillip. Let me see. How would
this do: &#8216;Nelson expects that every man will do his
duty?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardy suggested that &#8220;England expects&#8221; would be
an improvement. Nelson agreed. The order was given;
and the message was soon fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p>What shouts of enthusiasm greeted the signal in
Trafalgar&#8217;s Bay! Every man took it as a message to
himself, and forthwith vowed to do what was expected
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Nelson. &#8220;I can do no more. We
must trust to the great Disposer of events and the
justice of our cause. I thank God for this opportunity
of doing my duty!&#8221;</p>

<p>For all his apparent good spirits the Admiral had a
foreboding of impending ill, and when Captain Blackwood
left him to take up his place on the <i>Euryalus</i>,
the Admiral gripped him by the hand and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, Blackwood! I shall never see you
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The battle was opened by the French ship <i>Fougueux</i>,
which fired upon the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Engage the enemy more closely,&#8221; was now Nelson&#8217;s
signal, and the English closed in upon the foe.
Collingwood broke through the enemy&#8217;s line astern the
<i>Santa Anna</i>. He reserved his fire until he was almost
at the muzzles of their guns, then, with a roar, his
port broadside was hurled at the <i>Santa Anna</i>, and four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
hundred men fell killed and wounded, and fourteen of
the Spaniard&#8217;s guns were put out of action.</p>

<p>The starboard guns spoke to the <i>Fougueux</i> at the
same time. Owing to the dense smoke and the greater
distance, the damage done was not so great.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Rotherham!&#8221; cried Collingwood to his
flag-captain. &#8220;What would Nelson give to be here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; says James in his Naval History, &#8220;by a
singular coincidence Lord Nelson, the moment he saw
his friend in his enviable position, exclaimed: &#8216;See
how that noble fellow Collingwood carries his ship into
action.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Collingwood now pressed still closer on the <i>Santa
Anna</i>, and a smart battle began between the two great
ships, till four other ships bore down upon the <i>Royal
Sovereign</i>, so that she was very soon the centre of a
ring of fire. So close were the ships, and so continuous
was the fire, that often cannon-balls met in mid-air,
though more frequently they fell on board and did much
damage. Badly aimed shots often passed over the
<i>Royal Sovereign</i>, and found their mark on the decks of
French or Spanish vessels. Presently the four new-comers
veered off when they noticed that other British
ships were bearing down upon them.</p>

<p>With a roar the British <i>Belleisle</i> sent a broadside
into the <i>Santa Anna</i> as she passed; and then Collingwood
was alone with his foe. For over an hour the
duel raged, and the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, although she
carried a dozen guns fewer than the <i>Santa Anna</i>, suffered
less. Battered, mastless, with hundreds of men
lying in pools of blood, the <i>Santa Anna</i> still fought on,
refusing for a long time to strike her colours. At
last, however, there was nothing for it but to give in,
and the Spanish flag fluttered down the mast.</p>

<p>When the battle began the foe opened fire at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
<i>Victory</i>, which they knew was Nelson&#8217;s flagship. The
English Admiral had made sure that he should not be
lost sight of, for he had hoisted several flags lest one
should be carried away. The <i>Victory&#8217;s</i> maintopgallant
sail was shot away, and broadsides were hurled at her,
but still she kept on.</p>

<p>Nelson wished to encounter Villeneuve, and, despite
a raking fire poured in upon him by the <i>Santissima
Trinidad</i>, he kept on his way, taking the <i>Victory</i> into
the thick of the fight. He refused to have the hammocks
slung higher lest they should interrupt his view,
although they would have afforded shelter from the
enemy&#8217;s fire. Men dropped all about the ship, shots
ploughed up the deck or bored their way through the
sides, yet the gallant <i>Victory</i> held on her way for the
<i>Bucentaure</i>, which Nelson knew carried Admiral
Villeneuve.</p>

<p>Eight ships, however, surrounded her, and made it
impossible for the <i>Victory</i> to be brought alongside.
These, belching forth their heavy fire at her, smashed
her wheel, hurled her mizzen-mast overboard, shattered
her sails. The wind had dropped, too; the <i>Victory</i> was
almost at a standstill, and it was impossible to bring a
gun into action.</p>

<p>Pacing his quarter-deck Nelson waited for his time
to come. While doing so, a shot passed between him
and Hardy, bruising the latter&#8217;s foot, and tearing the
buckle from his shoe. Both stopped in their promenade,
looking anxiously at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too warm work to last long, Hardy,&#8221; said
Nelson.</p>

<p>&#8220;The enemy are closing up their line, sir,&#8221; said
Hardy. &#8220;See! We can&#8217;t get through without running
one of them aboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that,&#8221; said Nelson, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
that it matters much which we tackle first. Take your
choice. Go on board which you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Villeneuve on the <i>Bucentaure</i> was therefore given
a treble-shotted, close-range broadside, which disabled
four hundred men and put twenty guns out of action,
and left the ship almost defenceless.</p>

<p>Then, porting his helm, Nelson bore down on the
<i>Redoutable</i> and the <i>Neptune</i>. The latter veered off,
but the former could not escape the <i>Victory</i>, which she
therefore received with a broadside. Then, fearing that
a boarding party would enter her, the lower deck ports
were shut. Meanwhile the <i>Temeraire</i> had fastened on
to the <i>Redoutable</i> on the other side, and the most
momentous episode in that great day&#8217;s work took place.
In it we can see the difference between the naval fighting
of a century ago and that of to-day, the latter being
fought at long range, with no attempt at boarding.</p>

<p>The <i>Victory&#8217;s</i> guns were depressed so that they
should not do damage to the <i>Temeraire</i>, and broadside
after broadside was poured into the <i>Redoutable</i>, which
made a brave show. The two ships were almost rubbing
sides (now we fight at eight-mile range or more!),
and men stood by the British guns with buckets of water
in their hands, which, immediately the guns were fired,
they emptied into the hole made in the <i>Redoutable&#8217;s</i>
side lest she should catch fire, and so the prize be lost.</p>

<p>In the <i>Redoutable&#8217;s</i> top riflemen were posted, and
throughout the fight picked off man after man&mdash;a practice
which Nelson himself abhorred. It was from one
of these snipers that the great Admiral received his
death-wound.</p>

<p>While pacing the poop deck, Nelson suddenly swung
round and pitched forward on his face. A ball had
entered in at the left shoulder, and passed through his
backbone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Hardy, turning, saw three men lifting him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have done for me at last, Hardy,&#8221; Nelson
said feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not!&#8221; cried Hardy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;my backbone is shot
through!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bearers carried him down the ladders to the
lower deck. On the way, despite his awful agony,
Nelson had thoughts for nothing but the battle; he
ordered that new tiller ropes should be rigged to replace
those which had been shot away at the moment the
<i>Victory</i> had crashed into the <i>Redoutable</i>. Then, that
they might not recognise him, he covered his face and
stars with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>They carried him into the cockpit. We will leave
him, and return to the conflict.</p>

<p>The men in the <i>Redoutable&#8217;s</i> top still kept up their
galling fire, as also did the guns of the second deck,
and in less than fifteen minutes after Nelson had been
shot down, no fewer than fifty of the <i>Victory&#8217;s</i> officers
and men had met a like fate.</p>

<p>Then the French determined to board. As it was
impossible to do this by the bulwarks, they lowered
their main yard and turned it into a bridge, over which
they scrambled on to the deck of the <i>Victory</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Repel boarders!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a cry like that of a wild beast, and it brought
the lion&#8217;s whelps from the lower decks. They hurled
themselves at the venturesome Frenchmen. With pistol
and pike, cutlass and axe, the English fought with the
ferocity that had made them so dreaded in the past;
when other weapons failed they fought with bare fists,
hurling the trespassers overboard.</p>

<p>It cost the <i>Victory</i> thirty men to repel that attack.
But it cost the <i>Redoutable</i> more; and very soon not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
a Frenchman was left alive on the decks of Nelson&#8217;s
ship.</p>

<p>As we have said, while the <i>Victory</i> was engaging
the <i>Redoutable</i> on one side, the <i>Temeraire</i> was tackling
her on the other, the three ships hugging each
other with muzzles touching muzzles. Soon after the
attempt to board the <i>Victory</i>, the <i>Temeraire</i> lashed her
bowsprit to the gangway of the <i>Redoutable</i> so that she
could not escape. Then she poured in a raking fire
until the Frenchman was compelled to surrender, though
not before she had twice been on fire, and more than
five hundred of her crew had been killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Some of the <i>Temeraire</i> men then turned to deal with
the <i>Fougueux</i>, which had attacked her during the fight
with the <i>Redoutable</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Hardy was too busy with the <i>Redoutable</i>
to do much; but Lieutenant Kennedy quickly set a
party to man the starboard batteries. With these they
opened fire at about one hundred yards, and crash! the
<i>Fougueux&#8217;s</i> masts fell, her wheel was smashed, her
rigging shattered, and she was so crippled that she ran
foul of the <i>Temeraire</i>, whose crew lashed their foe to
them, and Kennedy, with a couple of middies and
fewer than thirty seamen and marines, rushed aboard
her.</p>

<p>Five hundred Frenchmen were still fresh for battle
on the <i>Fougueux</i>, but the Britishers did not hesitate.
With a bound they were on the enemy&#8217;s deck, and,
slashing and hacking at the crowd that came up against
them, drove them back and still back. Dozens were
killed and others leapt overboard to escape the whirlwind
that had fallen upon them. The remainder scuttled
away below, the English clapped the hatches on them,
and the ship was won.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Kennedy, with a couple of middies and fewer than thirty men, rushed aboard&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Victory</i> had been pouring a heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
fire into the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i> on one side and the
<i>Redoutable</i> on the other. Through and through the
former was raked, her deck swept clear of men, until
the Spaniards dived overboard and swam off to the
<i>Victory</i>, whose crew helped them aboard.</p>

<p>The <i>Belleisle</i>, which had hurled her broadside into
the <i>Santa Anna</i> early in the conflict, had been pounced
upon by about half a dozen ships of the enemy, which
poured in a deadly fire, battering her sides, tearing her
rigging to pieces, and twisting her mizzen-mast over
the aft guns, putting them out of action. Sixty men
also had been sent to their account, but the rest fought
on with British courage.</p>

<p>The <i>Achille</i> bore down upon her and attacked her
aft, the <i>Aigle</i>, assisted by the <i>Neptune</i>, fell on her starboard,
aiming at her remaining masts and bringing
them down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crippled, but unconquered,&#8221; masts gone by the
board, nearly all the guns useless, men mostly killed
or wounded, the <i>Belleisle&#8217;s</i> few remaining men stood to
their three or four guns and hurled defiance at the foe.
Pounding away for all they were worth, not a man
flinched&mdash;except at the thought that the flag had been
shot away. They fastened a Union Jack to a pikehead,
waved it defiantly, yelled out a cheer of determination,
and fought on again, keeping their ship in action
throughout the battle, refusing to strike the pikehead
flag.</p>

<p>The English <i>Neptune</i> assailed the <i>Bucentaure</i>, and
brought her main- and mizzen-masts down; then the
<i>Leviathan</i> came up, and at a range of about thirty yards
gave the French flagship a full broadside which smashed
the stern to splinters. The <i>Conqueror</i> completed the
work thus begun, and brought down the flag.</p>

<p>A marine officer and five men put off from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
<i>Conqueror</i> to take possession. Villeneuve and two chief
officers at once gave their swords to the officer, who,
thinking that the honour of accepting them belonged
to his captain, refused the weapons, put the Frenchmen
in his boat, pocketed the key of the magazine, left two
sentries to guard the cabin doors, and then pulled away
to rejoin his ship. For some time the little boat searched
for the <i>Conqueror</i>, which had gone in quest of other
foes. Eventually, however, the boat was picked up by
the <i>Mars</i>, whose acting commander, Lieutenant Hennah,
accepted the surrendered swords, and ordered
Villeneuve and his two captains below.</p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i> next tackled the Spanish <i>San
Augustino</i>, which opened fire on her at a hundred yards.
The <i>Leviathan</i> replied with fine effect, bringing down
the Spaniard&#8217;s mizzen-mast and flag. Then she lashed
herself to her foe. Clearing the way for boarders by a
galling fire, the English captain sent across his boarding
party. A hand-to-hand fight took place, and the
Spaniards were steadily but surely forced over the side
or below, and at last the ship was won.</p>

<p>The French <i>Intr&eacute;pide</i>, seeing the plight of her ally,
now bore down on the <i>Leviathan</i>, raking her with fire
as she came, and getting her boarders ready for attack.
They did not board, for the <i>Africa</i> pitted herself against
the <i>Intr&eacute;pide</i>, and smaller though she was got the best
of it, and the Frenchmen were compelled to strike their
flag.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Prince</i> and the <i>Swiftsure</i> were engaged
with the <i>Achille</i>, into which many English ships
had sent stinging shots, bringing her masts to the deck,
and making the ship a blazing mass. Unable to quench
the flames, the crew began cutting the masts, intending
to heave them overboard.</p>

<p>The <i>Prince</i>, however, gave her a broadside which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
did the cutting, and sent the wreckage down into the
waists. The whole ship immediately took fire. The
<i>Prince</i> and the <i>Swiftsure</i>, ceasing fire, sent their boats
to save the Frenchmen. It was a noble but dangerous
act, for the heat discharged the <i>Achille&#8217;s</i> guns, and
many of the would-be rescuers perished as a result.
Blazing hulk though she was, the <i>Achille</i> kept her
colours flying bravely, her sole surviving senior officer,
a middy, refusing to strike. The flames reached her
magazine, and with colours flying she blew up, carrying
all her remaining men heavenwards.</p>

<p>Meantime, Nelson lay dying in the cockpit of the
<i>Victory</i> in agony, yet rejoicing that he was victorious.
The rank and file were kept ignorant of his condition,
though the Admiral himself knew that the end was near,
and urged the surgeons to give their attention to others.
&#8220;He was in great pain, and expressed much anxiety
for the event of the action, which now began to declare
itself. As often as a ship struck the crew of the <i>Victory</i>
hurrahed, and at every hurrah a visible expression of
joy gleamed in the eyes and marked the countenance
of the dying hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every now and then Nelson asked for Hardy. &#8220;Will
no one bring Hardy to me?&#8221; he cried; and when at
last Hardy came, the two friends shook hands in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Hardy, how goes the day with us?&#8221; asked
Nelson presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, my lord. We have got twelve or fourteen
of the enemies&#8217; ships, but five of their van have
tacked, and show an intention of bearing down on the
<i>Victory</i>. I have therefore called two or three of our
fresh ships round us, and have no doubt of giving them
a drubbing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope none of <i>our</i> ships have struck, Hardy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my lord; there is no fear of that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Well, I am a dead man, Hardy, but I am glad of
what you say. Oh, whip them now you&#8217;ve got them;
whip them as they&#8217;ve never been whipped before!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardy then left him for a time, returning somewhat
later to report that some fourteen ships had been taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well,&#8221; cried Nelson, &#8220;though I bargained
for twenty. Anchor, Hardy, anchor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardy suggested that Admiral Collingwood might
now take over the direction of affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while I live, Hardy!&#8221; said Nelson. &#8220;Do <i>you</i>
anchor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we make the signal, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Nelson. &#8220;For if I live, I&#8217;ll
anchor.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a little while Hardy looked down at his admiral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me, Hardy,&#8221; said Nelson; and Hardy kissed
him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t have my poor carcass hove overboard,&#8221;
whispered Nelson, as Hardy leant over him. &#8220;Get
what&#8217;s left of me sent to England, if you can manage
it. Kiss me, Hardy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardy kissed him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; asked the hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Hardy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye. God bless you, Hardy. Thank God,
I&#8217;ve done my duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hardy left him&mdash;for ever.</p>

<p>Nelson was turned on to his right side, muttered
the words that he would soon be gone. Then, after a
little silence, he sighed and struggled to speak, but all
he could say was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, I have done my duty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Nelson died; and England was the poorer by
her greatest sea captain.</p>

<p>Hardy took the news to Collingwood, who assumed
command, and refused to carry out Nelson&#8217;s instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to anchor, because the fact that a gale was blowing up
would make it unsafe to do so.</p>

<p>The battle was now over; the allied fleets had been
defeated, eighteen of their ships were captured, and
with these Collingwood stood out to sea. The enemy,
however, recaptured four of the prizes, one escaped to
Cadiz, some went down with all hands, others were
stranded, and one was so unseaworthy that it was
scuttled; and only four were taken into Gibraltar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for a different picture!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the early hours of August 28, 1914. Under
cover of the darkness and the fog, the first and third
flotillas of our destroyers, commanded by Commodore
R. Y. Tyrwhitt, under orders from the Admiralty, had
crept towards Heligoland Bight, preceded by submarines
E6, E7, E8, and followed by the first battle
cruiser squadron and the first light cruiser squadron.</p>

<p>The submarines, submerged to the base of their
conning-towers, swept into the Bight, and when the
grey fingers of the dawn crept across the sky the
Germans behind the fortress saw what they imagined
was a British submarine in difficulties, with sister ships
alongside, and two cruisers, <i>Lurcher</i> and <i>Drake</i>, in
attendance, intent only on giving her assistance until
help could reach them.</p>

<p>It was nothing more than a trap, into which the
Germans fell.</p>

<p>A torpedo boat destroyer swung out of the harbour,
making full steam ahead for the apparently helpless
submarines, who kept their hazardous positions until
they saw that the Germans had come far away from
the island fortress. Then, one after the other, they sank,
and simultaneously the cruisers swung about and raced
madly away from the German torpedo craft.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Search though they did, the Germans found no trace
of the submarines; all they could see were light cruisers
tearing away from them at full speed. These cruisers
had acted as an additional decoy, and other destroyers
slipped out, bent on making short work of the Britishers
who had dared to flaunt themselves within sight of Heligoland.
Then, in the distance, appeared the funnels of
other British cruisers and destroyers; and it would seem
that the Germans realised that they had fallen into a
trap, and endeavoured to escape, for Commodore
Tyrwhitt&#8217;s dispatch says: &#8220;The <i>Arethusa</i> and the third
flotilla were engaged with numerous destroyers and
torpedo boats which were making for Heligoland; course
thus altered to port to cut them off.&#8221; This was from
7.20 to 7.57 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, when two German cruisers appeared
on the scene and were engaged.</p>

<p>It was a gallant fight. The jolly Jack Tars of Britain
had been waiting these many days for a smack at the foe,
who had not dared to come out and meet them until it
seemed they were in overwhelming force; and now, when
the opportunity had come, they entered into the fight
with a zest worthy of the Navy that rules the seas. They
watched their shots; the gunlayers worked methodically,
as though at target practice; and when a shot went
home, men cheered lustily and rubbed their hands with
glee.</p>

<p>And the Germans began to think they had a handful
of work before them, despite numbers.</p>

<p>They had a bigger handful soon! Here and there,
with startling suddenness, periscopes dotted the water,
to be followed by the grey shells of submarines, which,
getting the range for their torpedoes, as quickly disappeared,
and became a menace to the German ships.
It began to dawn upon the foe that they were being
trapped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Full speed ahead!&#8221; had come the command when
the Germans were sighted, and on went the destroyers
in the van. &#8220;We just went for them,&#8221; said one of the
sailors afterwards; &#8220;and when we got within range we
let them have it hot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hot it was, when at last they did come to grips.
But before that happened other things were to take
place. The cruiser <i>Arethusa</i>, leader of the third destroyer
flotilla&mdash;a new ship, by the way, only out of
dock these forty-eight hours, of 30,000 horsepower,
with a 2-inch belt of armour, and 4-inch and 6-inch guns&mdash;sped
on towards the Germans, who, owing to the
morning mist, could not see how many foes they were
to meet, and fondly dreamed they were in the majority.</p>

<p>The German cruisers, like the destroyers, were
successfully decoyed out to sea, and then the real
fighting began.</p>

<p>The <i>Arethusa</i> tackled some of the destroyers and
two cruisers, one a four-funnelled vessel. A few range-finding
shots, then the aim was obtained, and a
shell put the German&#8217;s bow gun out of action. The
<i>Fearless</i> and the <i>Arethusa</i> were now in &#8220;Full action,&#8221;
and, together with the destroyers of the flotilla, were
quickly engaged in a stern piece of work.</p>

<p>The saucy <i>Arethusa</i> didn&#8217;t budge when the second
cruiser (two funnels) came at her, but simply fired
away for all she was worth. For over half an hour
she fought the Germans at a range of 3,000 yards.
What would Nelson have thought of this long-distance
fighting? And &#8220;it was a fight in semi-darkness, when
it was only just possible,&#8221; wrote one of her crew, &#8220;to
make out the opposing grey shadow. Hammer, hammer,
hammer, it was, until the eyes ached and smarted and
the breath whistled through lips parched with the acrid
fumes of picric acid.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>It was a gallant fight. Those deadly 6-inch guns of
hers did their proper work, and battered at the Germans;
while, on the other hand, the Germans battered away
at her; apparently misliking her entertainment, the four-funnelled
German turned her attention to the <i>Fearless</i>,
which kept her men as busy as bees for a time.
About ten minutes, and the <i>Arethusa</i> planted a
6-inch shell on the forebridge of the German, and
sent her scurrying away to Heligoland. But the
<i>Arethusa</i> had not escaped injury in the stern fight, and
once or twice, but for the gallant assistance of the
<i>Fearless</i> and the destroyers, she seemed likely to be even
more severely damaged, if not destroyed. As it was, a
shell entered her engine-room, all her guns but one were
put out of action, a fire broke out opposite No. 2 port
gun, and was promptly handled by Chief Petty Officer
Wrench.</p>

<p>Presently the <i>Arethusa</i> drew off for a while, like a
gladiator getting his wind, ready to come back again.</p>

<p>And while the <i>Arethusa&#8217;s</i> crew were working like
niggers putting things to rights, the <i>Fearless</i> standing
by to help, the British destroyers were engaged in
swift, destructive, rushing-about conflicts, now with
opposing destroyers, now with German cruisers. Two
of the British &#8220;wasps&#8221; tackled a couple of cruisers, for
instance. Getting in between their larger foes, they
placed the latter in such a quandary that they did not
know what to do. To fire meant risking hitting each
other, and, seizing the hazardous opportunity, the destroyers
worked their will upon their opponents; and
then, when it was not possible to do more, sped off into
the haze. The <i>Liberty</i> and <i>Laertes</i> did good work
during these early hours of the fighting. They opposed
themselves to several German craft, roared out their
thunderous welcome &#8220;to the North Sea,&#8221; and, with well-aimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
shots, sent one boat out of the fighting line
with a hole clean through her hull, wrenched off the
funnel of another, smashed up the after gun of yet a
third, and blew the platform itself to pieces.</p>

<p>Aye, &#8217;twas a glorious scrum! Yet not without its
nasty knocks for the Britishers. Standing on his
bridge, working his ship, Lieutenant-Commander Nigel
Barttelot heard the crash of a shell as it struck his mast;
and before he could move the whole structure had fallen
with a crash upon the bridge, killing him and a signaller
instantly.</p>

<p>The <i>Laertes</i>, too, received her punishment. Her
for&#8217;ard gun was damaged, and its crew either killed or
wounded, while the &#8217;midship funnel was ripped from
top to bottom, and a shell sang its horrific way into
the dynamo-room, while another made havoc of her
cabin.</p>

<p>Presently the <i>Arethusa</i>, her wreckage cleared away,
her guns&mdash;some of them&mdash;working again, steamed into
the battle area, and, undaunted as ever, took on another
couple of German cruisers. &#8220;It looked as if she was in
for a warm time,&#8221; said one of the crew; &#8220;but the fortunate
arrival of our battle squadron relieved the
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first light cruiser squadron came first, and
engaged the Germans.</p>

<p>There is much meaning in that &#8220;fortunate arrival.&#8221;
It had been planned and carried out to a nicety. Vice-Admiral
Sir David Beatty and the two cruiser squadrons
had been waiting, as arranged&mdash;waiting for the time to
come when he should go to the aid of the torpedo
flotillas. While waiting the squadrons were attacked
by German submarines, which were not successful in
wounding any of the ships. A German seaplane, scouting
over the North Sea, espied the squadrons, and sped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
back to Heligoland with the news. They brought out
reinforcements, which made the flotillas signal to the
vice-admiral for help. This was before noon.</p>

<p>The first light cruiser squadron came first, and
swept the Germans with a tornado of fire. Then, when
the <i>Fearless</i> and the first flotilla were returning, while
the light cruiser squadron engaged the enemy, the battle
cruiser squadron came up: the <i>Lion</i>, the <i>Princess
Royal</i>, the <i>New Zealand</i>, and the <i>Invincible</i>, armed,
the first two, with 13.5 guns, and the others with
12-inch. The work that the <i>Arethusa</i> and her smaller
fry had commenced was now carried to a finish. The
German cruisers <i>Mainz</i> and <i>K&ouml;ln</i> shook to the impact of
the rain of shells poured upon them; great holes were
torn in their sides, flames spurted out, and roared their
angry way about the ships. The <i>Mainz</i>, more badly
wounded, was in a sinking condition before the arrival
of the battle cruisers, and now, tortured by the horrific
projectiles, began to sink rapidly by the head. With
a <i>siss! siss!</i> as the flames met water, and a roar as the
boilers exploded, the good ship <i>Mainz</i>, after a plucky
fight, went to her last anchorage, followed later by the
<i>K&ouml;ln</i>.</p>

<p>Destroyers which had been battering at the unfortunate
Germans now ceased their fire, and sped
towards them on errands of mercy, seeking to save
their foes. A large number of the crew of over 350
of the <i>Mainz</i> still lived, and the destroyers&#8217; crews were
horrified to see that German officers were shooting at
their own men as the ship began to sink rapidly by the
head. The <i>Lurcher</i> (Commodore Roger J. B. Keyes)
rescued 220 of her crew.</p>

<p>British sailors helping to rescue the crew told later
that the scene on deck was terrible. Steelwork had been
twisted and bent as hairpins bend; the deck was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
shambles&mdash;grim testimony to the deadly character of
the British fire.</p>

<p>While the destroyers were still fighting, after the
sinking of the <i>Mainz</i> and <i>K&ouml;ln</i>, a third German
cruiser, the <i>Ariadne</i>, appeared on the scene, and, after
the destroyers had tackled her unsuccessfully, the battle
cruisers, turning from their earlier victims, spoke to
her in the language of death. Shells fell all about her,
battering her sides, gouging great holes in her, wrecking
her so completely that within a short time she was
going down to keep the <i>Mainz</i> and <i>K&ouml;ln</i> company.
Later it was reported that yet a fourth cruiser had
been set on fire.</p>

<p>We must now go back to the destroyer action, which
was no less sharp than the other. The small craft sped
here and there, firing their 4-inch guns as rapidly as
possible, and inflicting damage on one another. Out of
the chaos of the fighting there shone the bright light
of foes who would show mercy. The German destroyer
V187 was so badly mauled that there was no hope for
her or her crew, and the British destroyer <i>Goshawk</i>
ordered the others to cease fire while she lowered her
boats and sought to rescue the Germans, who, however,
heeding not the humane mission of their foes, opened
fire on the <i>Goshawk</i> at a range of about 200 yards. The
German official reports eulogised this as &#8220;a glorious
fight,&#8221; but the British tars saw in it something other
than &#8220;glorious.&#8221; Forced to fight even when they would
save, they opened fire in reply; and in double quick
time the V187 was silenced, and began to settle down,
her men being flung or leaping into the shell-whipped
seas. British boats now endeavoured to save the lives
of the men who had fired at them when they would
have done so before, and several boats managed to pick
up survivors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>But, as if the blatant callousness of V187 were not
enough, a German cruiser came swinging up, and
opened a deadly fire upon the destroyers&mdash;the boats
whose errand was a merciful one. The destroyers, picking
up what boats they could, made away at full speed;
but some boats, containing Britishers and Germans,
were left behind. At that moment, Lieut.-Commodore
Leir, of submarine E4, appeared on the scene, and
engaged the cruiser, which altered her course before he
could get the range. Down went E4 for safety&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>The two boats of the <i>Defender</i>, left thus, were in a
precarious situation, shells flying all about them and
their ship far away. Then, to their amazement, there
appeared on the surface the periscope of a submarine;
then, presently, the conning-tower. It was E4 again.
This time she hailed the boats, and, though she was a
plain mark for the cruiser&#8217;s fire, she remained on the
surface, bent on saving whom she could. She could
not embark them all, but took a lieutenant and nine
men of the <i>Defender</i>. There were also two of the
officers and eight men of V187, unwounded, and
eighteen wounded men, and, unable to take them on
board, Leir left an officer and six unwounded men to
navigate the British boats to Heligoland, taking steps
to see that they were provided with water, biscuits,
and a compass. It was the British sailor all over!</p>

<p>Thus it was that the Battle of the Bight was fought&mdash;and
won&mdash;by the tars of Old Britain. They had
hankered long after the outcoming of the Germans,
who sulked in their harbours, and had had to be lured
out. Boldly had the Germans issued forth when the
odds had seemed all on their side, when they saw
before them but a few small vessels; and, to their credit
be it said, they fought well when the truth came to
them. It was the first engagement in the war worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of the name of a naval battle, and the British reaped
the honours, though, when the tally was taken, they
had not escaped scot free. There were battered ships
amongst those that put into port later. The <i>Liberty</i>
had fourteen great holes in her port bow, her bridge
was smashed, her searchlight gone, her wireless installation
vanished, and nothing but a stump remained of
her mast. The <i>Laertes</i>, hit four times, had had to be
taken in tow for a while, and the <i>Arethusa</i>, who had
started the fight in good style, had, as we have seen,
received much beating about. The <i>Fearless</i> also had
honourable wounds, receiving no fewer than nineteen
hits, though none of them in a vital part.</p>

<p>Beginning in the early morning, with the sea-mist
shrouding the sea, the battle had continued for six or
seven hours; and then the Germans, knowing themselves
outmatched, drew off, dropping mines as they
went, while the British squadrons, finding there was
nothing more to be done when the Germans had scurried
to the shelter of their harbour, also drew away, without a
ship lost, and with but comparatively few men <i>hors de
combat</i>. During the return journey some of the British
cruisers were attacked by submarines but escaped
damage. The saucy <i>Arethusa</i>, wounded pretty badly,
steamed away at about six knots until 7 o&#8217;clock, and
then, finding it impossible to proceed farther, drew her
fire in all boilers except two and called for assistance.
Up came the <i>Hogue</i>, at 9.30, and took her in tow, while
the <i>Amethyst</i> took in tow the <i>Laurel</i>, which had also
suffered a fair amount of damage.</p>

<p>Thus, with the blood surging through their veins
as they thought of the victory won, and longing for
the day to come when they might once more meet their
foes, the British tars steamed to port. Five months
later there was another action on a large scale.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>What would the hero of Trafalgar have said if
anyone had suggested to him the possibility of a
running battle in which the opponents should never
be nearer than eight miles? He would probably not
have regarded it as a fight! In those good old times
the guns could not carry much more than a thousand
yards, and the end very often came by boarders, and
the capture of the ship in a hand-to-hand fight.
Nowadays sea fights are at long range; and yet another
account of a battle in the North Sea (January 24,
1915) shows how greatly methods of warfare have
changed. It is difficult to imagine the story of such
a fight, as will be understood when the classes of ships
engaged are considered: mighty battle cruisers, such
as the <i>Lion</i>, whose guns can fire 10 miles, hurling a
broadside of 10,000 lbs. twice in every minute; light
cruisers, speedy destroyers, and submarines; while over
all hovered the long grey shapes of airships and the
darting forms of seaplanes dropping bombs. And all
the time the battling ships are tearing through the seas
at top speed, belching forth terrible high-explosive
shells.</p>

<p>The battle of January 24 was the outcome of a
German attempt to raid the east coast of England,
as had been done before&mdash;Yarmouth first, then the
Hartlepools, Scarborough, and Whitby. In the case
of the last three towns a large number of defenceless
women and children had been murdered by the German
fire, and the War Lord proclaimed it a mighty victory
for his navy. Issuing forth again, in the hope of
achieving something as noble, the German admiral
brought with him four battle cruisers, six light cruisers,
and two flotillas of torpedo craft and submarines. When
about thirty miles off the English coast they were
sighted by a light cruiser, which engaged them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
signalled to Admiral Beatty&#8217;s squadron the news
of the coming of the foe. Instantly the British
vessels, which had been cleared for action for over an
hour (it was now 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>), closed up and prepared to
chase the raiders, then 14 miles away. Admiral
Beatty&#8217;s force, thus once more destined to play its part
in the drama of war, consisted of the battle cruiser
squadron&mdash;<i>Lion</i> (flagship), <i>Tiger</i>, <i>Princess Royal</i>, <i>Indomitable</i>,
<i>New Zealand</i>, and several light cruisers and
torpedo craft. The battle cruisers were Britain&#8217;s most
formidable fighting ships, outcome of what proved to
be a far-sighted policy, namely, that of big guns; the
first three carried twenty-four 13.5-in. guns, and the
last two sixteen 12-in. guns, against which the German
<i>Derfflinger</i> (a new ship) had eight 12-in. guns, the
<i>Moltke</i> and <i>Seydlitz</i> twenty 11-in., and the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>
twelve 8-in. guns. It will be seen, therefore, that the
British ships had the superiority in weight and range.</p>

<p>As soon as the news was brought to the admiral
he gave instructions for the destroyers to chase the
enemy and report his movements, while the squadron
steered south-east, &#8220;with a view to securing the lee
position, and to cut off the enemy, if possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Germans, immediately they realised that they
had been seen, and that they were about to be met by
a large force, turned tail and ran away. It must not
be thought that this was a sign of cowardice; far from
it, for in all probability the German man&#339;uvre was
deliberate, and in keeping with the policy that had
arranged the larger number of heavier guns in the
stern of the ships, so that, in the event of a running
fight, such as this was destined to be, the fleeing ships
would not be at a disadvantage. The British ships have
the majority of their guns fixed to fire ahead. One great
disadvantage attaching to pursuers lies in the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the ships fleeing before them may drop mines, into
which the chasing ships might run.</p>

<p>Working at a speed of from 28 to 29 knots an hour,
the British squadron raced after the Germans, gradually
overhauling them, and at 20,000 yards opened
fire upon the foe, keeping at it until, at 18,000 yards&#8217;
range, the shots began to tell, and the fire was returned
by the Germans. The fight had begun in real earnest.
The German destroyers made a plucky attack, in the
hope of torpedoing the British ships, but the &#8220;M&#8221;
division of British destroyers raced ahead of the cruisers
and engaged the Germans and drove them off. The
German destroyers belched forth great clouds of smoke,
which screened the cruisers from their pursuers.</p>

<p>The British <i>Lion</i>, of course, led the way. Steering
clear of the German submarines, which were to the
starboard, she pounded after the great cruisers, and her
great shells began to fall in a shower upon the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>,
which, being the slowest ship, was at the tail of the
German line. Not only the <i>Lion</i>, but practically every
British ship poured in smashing salvoes. They fell
upon her thick as hailstones, sweeping her decks, crashing
into her sides, smashing upon her guns and
wrenching them from their turrets, disabling whole
gun crews. Funnels were sent toppling over, masts
fell; a shell pitched in the very heart of the ship, where
a large number of men were gathered, and killed them
all. Her armoured sides were riddled through and
through; she was on fire; but she still kept up her
replies with the guns left her, and her men cheered
as they fought, although they knew they were fighting
a losing battle. Instructions had been given that the
flag was not to be struck, and that she was to go down
with it flying. Within half an hour of the opening of
the battle 300 or 400 men were killed or wounded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
She was an unforgettable sight. She turned to port,
to give her men a chance to put out the fire, but after
awhile swung back and made after the other ships.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see the result of their attack
on the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>, the British big ships pounded on their
way after the other vessels. A devastating cyclone of
shells fell upon the <i>Derfflinger</i>, which caught fire forward
and had many guns put out of action, while the
<i>Seydlitz</i> or the <i>Moltke</i> steamed on like a sheet of flame.
The roar of the guns, the crash of the explosions, the
thunder of the great engines of war as they romped
through the seas, the flashes of fire as shells left the
maws of the terrific weapons&mdash;all went to make up a
scene of horror, of impressiveness. It was a battle
between rival giants at giants&#8217; distance, while simultaneously
another battle was raging between the smaller
cruisers and torpedo craft. There is no doubt that one
reason why the Germans chose a running fight was
that they hoped to be able to lure their pursuers into
the minefield round about Heligoland. But, after chasing
them for about a hundred miles, Admiral Beatty,
realising that it was hopeless to catch them before they
reached the field, turned back from the great cruisers
and set his attention upon the smaller ships, seeking
to turn them off, drive them down upon the British
cruisers which were in hot pursuit. He did great
damage amongst them, despite the difficulty of the
work, there being so many ships engaged. Though
many of them were very seriously mauled, they succeeded
in getting to the minefield&mdash;with guns dismounted
and hulls battered.</p>

<p>About 11 o&#8217;clock the <i>Lion</i> had her speed reduced
very considerably, owing to a chance shot that had
caught her in the bows and damaged her feed-tank,
putting her port engines out of action. Admiral Beatty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
therefore changed his flag to a destroyer, and, later,
to the <i>Princess Royal</i>, which then took the foremost
place in the fight. The <i>Lion</i>, whose starboard engine
also got out of working order later, and had only one
engine working, was shielded by the <i>Tiger</i>, which
pluckily placed herself in the way of the enemy&#8217;s fire,
and in doing so lost half a dozen of her men, though
she gave the Germans a good battering in return. The
<i>Lion</i> was then taken in tow by the <i>Indomitable</i>, and
eventually taken into port. An eye-witness on the
<i>Tiger</i> told of the part the <i>Tiger</i> played in this thrilling
action between big ships:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the gun-deck, where I was stationed, you could
hardly see one another for the smoke, but our chaps
stuck it like Britons. They did work hard; but they
did it with a good heart, and I believe at one time our
ship was engaging three of the enemy&#8217;s ships. Four
of their ships were on fire, but they could still keep on
firing, and I believe one or two of our poor chaps who
got on deck to have a look at them did not live long.
I myself was very anxious to go on deck and have a
look, but I am glad I did not. I saw the start, and
then went below. We lost ten of our chaps, and several
were wounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;A message came down from the deck, &#8216;All hands
on deck to see the enemy&#8217;s ship sink,&#8217; and in less
than five minutes after we could see nothing of her,
and our destroyers drew near to pick up survivors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our ship at one time stood all the brunt of the
firing, as we sheltered the leading ship in our line when
she got winged. Still, thank goodness for everything,
we are still alive and happy. I do not think they will
want to meet us again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i> was living her last
moments. Suddenly, while the Germans&#8217; guns were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
pounding away, there slipped from behind the bigger
ships the saucy <i>Arethusa</i>, intent on finishing the work
thus well begun. The <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>, being wounded almost
to the death, had no way upon her, and offered a fine
mark to torpedo. Commodore Tyrwhitt, of the
<i>Arethusa</i>, knowing this, gave instructions, and, as
the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i> fired her remaining guns in rapid succession,
a couple of torpedoes sped through the seas
towards her. The second caught her amidships, exploded,
and rent a great gap in her. Listing already,
she now simply heeled over &#8220;like a tin can filled with
water,&#8221; as one eye-witness put it.</p>

<p>It was a dramatic moment, crowded with heroism.
Her flag was still flying, and her men were crying,
&#8220;Hoch! Hoch!&#8221; as they lined the side of the vessel,
ready to jump clear. From the <i>Arethusa</i> there came
the cry of &#8220;Jump!&#8221; and almost at the same time
hundreds of men leaped into the water, most of them
equipped with inflated rubber lifebelts, which kept them
afloat until the boats lowered by the English picked
them up. While the British tars were employed in
this humane work there swung out from Heligoland
an airship and a seaplane, which hovered over the
rescuing boats and dropped bombs. Such methods
naturally aroused the anger of the British, who
promptly, for their own sakes, had to give up the work
of rescue, and leave many struggling Germans to find
death when they might have had life.</p>

<p>The <i>Indomitable</i>, before she took the <i>Lion</i> in tow,
had her share of the fighting, as had the other battle cruisers.
After having tackled the <i>Seydlitz</i>, she was
attacked by a Zeppelin which dropped a bomb about
forty yards away from her bridge. The <i>Indomitable</i> gave
her a taste of shrapnel, as did the <i>Tiger</i>, and she cleared
off. Then a torpedo was launched at the <i>Indomitable</i> by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>; but the speed of the British ship saved
her.</p>

<p>In addition to the <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i> sunk, other ships suffered
considerable damage, as we have seen. Previously one
of them had been engaged by the light cruiser <i>Aurora</i>,
which opened a terrific fire upon her. The first shot
carried the midship funnel clean away, and others,
poured in rapidly, swept the decks and battered her
hull, so that she was soon in a deplorable condition
and was fleeing at top speed for the safety of
harbour. Only the proximity of the minefield and the
accident to the <i>Lion</i> &#8220;deprived the British fleet of a
greater victory.&#8221; It was not until the foremost cruiser,
the <i>Derfflinger</i>, was within half an hour&#8217;s run of the
mined area that Admiral Beatty gave up the chase,
well pleased with the work that had been done.</p>

<p>It had been a great fight and a brilliant victory;
it had shown that the British Navy was true to its
traditions, that it could fight as well as exert silent pressure
upon the foe; that the commanders were fearless
men, and that the men behind the guns knew how to
handle their great weapons. The feature that stands
out most prominently is the accuracy of the British fire
as contrasted with that of the German; in the latter
case shots seemed to fall anywhere but on the British
ships, as is clear when the only casualties were seventeen
men wounded on the <i>Lion</i>, one officer and nine
men killed, and two officers and eight men wounded
on the <i>Tiger</i>; and four men killed and one man
wounded on the <i>Meteor</i>, which ship was attacked by
the Zeppelin, while none of the ships were at all badly
damaged, and would be ready for sea again in a few
days.</p>

<p>A fine victory, well won, and at little cost!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MEN WHO DISCOVERED THE
WORLD</h2>


<p class="ph1">Stories of the Early Voyagers</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is difficult for us who live in these days of swift
travel, wireless telegraphy, palatial ships, and so
forth, to realise what it meant to go a-voyaging in the
Middle Ages and thereabouts. Then men set out chartless,
at one time compassless, in ships which were mere
cockle-boats, to traverse unknown seas (there are no
unknown seas to-day!) in quest of new lands, not
knowing really whether there were any new lands to
discover. They went, as it were, into the darkness
of the unknown, with all its terrors and dangers; and
going, discovered the world.</p>

<p>Tradition had it that out in the Atlantic were some
islands called by the ancients the Fortunate Islands;
and the thirst for wider geographical knowledge came
with the discovery of these, and the discovery of
Madeira, in the fifteenth century; and out of the mists
of the legends there shone elusive islands which, though
men sought, they could not find. Then, as men grew
bolder, and travelled overland to Cathay, or China, to
bring back wonderful stories, with all the glamour of
the East about them, Europeans cried for more and
more light upon the world beyond Europe.</p>

<p>And the age of discovery began.</p>

<p>In the mind of every voyager was the one great
objective&mdash;Cathay. But the way there? One school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
said westwards; the other said that only by circumnavigating
the coasts of Africa could Cathay be reached.
We know now, as they discovered after many, many
years, that both routes led to the East, but that in
between Europe and Asia, via the West, lay a mighty
continent of whose existence they had never dreamed;
and which, when they did discover it, they thought was
Asia.</p>

<p>We cannot go into details of the many voyages
which were undertaken both to the south and the west;
we must content ourselves with the first voyage round
the Cape of Good Hope, the first sea trip to China,
and the first voyage of the great Columbus.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;A mighty gale caught Diaz and carried his frail craft before it&#8221;</p>

<p>It fell to the lot of Bartholomew Diaz to achieve the
first of these great epoch-marking events in the world&#8217;s
history. Many men, under the patronage of Prince
Henry the Navigator, of Portugal, had passed along
the African coast, and by 1484 Diego Cam had partly
explored the Congo; but two years later Diaz, heedless
of the fears and warnings of his crew, sailed past the
Congo, with the firm determination to get into the
Indian Ocean, or at least to pass the extremity of Africa,
if there were an extremity. Of that no one was sure.
Diaz went round that point without knowing it; a
mighty storm caught him, and carried his frail ship
before it, and when the gale passed over Diaz found
himself off a coast which trailed away eastwards and
ever eastwards. His men, fearful of they knew not
what, beseeched him to turn back, but for several days
Diaz held on his way. This eastward trend of the
coast meant something, though what it was he could
not say. At last the crew refused to go any farther;
the unknown held too many terrors for them, and they
considered they had done sufficient. They had gone
farther, they knew, than any mariners before them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Why keep on at the risk of being lost? So Diaz had
reluctantly to give way. He turned his vessel round,
passed down the coast, going southward, with the land
on his right&mdash;to him a significant fact. He realised its
full significance later when, passing a great promontory,
which, because of the storms that prevailed there, he
called the Cape of Storms, he found the land still on
his right, while the ship was sailing northwards. He
had been round Africa!</p>

<p>Promptly Diaz landed, and, as was the custom,
erected a pillar in the name of the King of Portugal,
and thus laid claim to the new land he had discovered.
Then home he went, full of joy at his achievement, to
receive a mighty welcome at Court when he had told
his story. The name of the southernmost cape thus
discovered was renamed the Cape of Good Hope; and
thus it has been known ever since.</p>

<p>One would have thought that this voyage would
have spurred on other voyagers to follow in the track
thus laid down; but for some reason or other it was
ten years before an expedition was dispatched to carry
it farther and try to reach Cathay by that route. Vasco
da Gama was the leader of this expedition, which left
the Tagus on July 7, 1497, five years after Columbus
had set out for the unknown West. It consisted of
three ships, which became separated soon after starting,
only to meet at Cape Verde Islands. Then for four
months they fought their way through storms until
they reached St. Helena, where, although they were
badly in need of provisions, they could get none, because
the natives were so unfriendly. So southward
they went, and at last came to the Cape of Good Hope,
which it took them two days to sail round, owing to the
terrific storm that raged. The crew, terrified at the
tumultuous seas, prayed da Gama to turn back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;We cannot pass this awful cape!&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;If God preserve us,&#8221; answered da Gama boldly,
&#8220;we will pass the cape and make our way to Cathay.
For that honour will be given us, and we shall get
much wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, though he thus appealed to their cupidity, the
crew were not to be calmed; and their dissatisfaction
gave rise to conspiracy. They intended to mutiny,
and force da Gama to turn back, or else kill him out
of hand, and then do what they wanted to do.</p>

<p>Da Gama, however, received information of the plot
from some of the men who were still faithful to him, and
were willing to follow him where he would lead. Knowing
that stern measures would be necessary now that
softer ones had failed, da Gama plotted on his own
account. He had each man brought into his cabin to
discuss the matter, and as soon as a head showed inside
the door the man was seized and put in irons. In this
way every one of the dissatisfied men was taken
prisoner; and da Gama found himself left with a mere
handful of men to work the ship. Yet did he persist
in going on; he would not be deterred, and, though all
worked hard in face of what they thought was certain
death, yet they weathered the cape, and presently were
on the way up the east coast of Africa. Then da Gama
freed his prisoners, who were shamefaced as they came
on deck, to find themselves in this new sea, safely past
the storm they had feared.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, after having been in at various
places, da Gama came to Natal, named thus in honour
of the Nativity, broke up one of his ships there, as
she was unseaworthy, and then went on, reaching
Mozambique on March 10. Here he met trouble again.
Mozambique was in the possession of the Moors, who
did a fine trade with the Indies and the Red Sea, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
naturally, resented the intrusion of the Portuguese.
They saw their trade being taken from them. They
therefore did all they could to destroy or capture the
intrepid voyagers, who, however, outwitted them every
time. At each place where they put in they fell foul of
the Moors, until they reached Melinda, where they were
received with honour, and were able to secure as many
provisions as they wanted.</p>

<p>Da Gama, always with his eyes open to discover
what commercial advantages were to be gained from his
voyage, saw with delight that at Melinda there were
many large ships which bore the riches of India in their
holds; and, realising that that meant much to Portugal,
as soon as the monsoons would allow him, hurried on
his way across the Indian Ocean, having secured the
services of a good native pilot. On May 20, 1498, the
two ships reached Calicut&mdash;the first vessels which had
arrived in India by the direct sea route.</p>

<p>It was an epoch-marking accomplishment, for it
opened up the Far East to Europe in a way that had not
been done before; trade could be carried on much more
easily than by the overland route, with its many dangers.
All the riches of the East&mdash;spices, peppers, and what not&mdash;were
to be had by the Portuguese now. The commercial
importance of the voyage was greater than that of
any voyage yet undertaken, for even that of Columbus
had not begun to bear the fruit it was to bear later on.</p>

<p>Da Gama, however, found that things were not so
rosy as they had seemed; the Moors held the trade of
Calicut in their hands. It was the trading centre of
the merchants of Ceylon and the Moluccas&mdash;indeed, of
all the Malabar coast&mdash;and the Moors there, like those
at Mozambique, feared the coming of the Europeans.
When they discovered that da Gama had obtained permission
from the zamorin, or native chief, to trade, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
plotted for his destruction, inducing the zamorin to take
him prisoner and capture his ships, telling him that
these white men would surely come in their hundreds
and take possession of his territory. Of course, the
native viewed the prospect with anything but pleasure,
and when da Gama, laden with rich gifts, landed, he
tried to capture him. Da Gama, however, slipped
through his fingers, reached his ships, and sailed away,
vowing to return and to take vengeance.</p>

<p>Leaving Calicut in a rage, the voyager traded with
another chief at Cannanore, and, having laden his
vessels with rich spices and peppers, set out on the
return voyage, reaching Lisbon in September, 1499; and
the whole nation went wild with delight at the glorious
vista opened to it.</p>

<p>Da Gama went back to Calicut later on to take his
revenge. He allied the King of Cannanore with him,
and wrought havoc with the zamorin&#8217;s trading vessels;
then sailed to Cochin China, where he established a
factory&mdash;the first factory in the East, and the beginning
of Portuguese power in the Orient.</p>

<p>We must now go back a few years, and glance at
the story of the first voyage of Columbus, the man who
stands out as a landmark in the history of the world.
He marks the beginning of the new geographical knowledge;
the old world is one side of him, the new the
other. For years he had been studying all the maps and
charts that he could get hold of, and had imbibed the
new knowledge that was being taught regarding the
shape of the earth, until at last he came to believe that
Asia could be reached by sailing to the west. He tried
this Court and that, only to receive rebuffs and meet
with delays that sickened him. He sent his brother
Bartholomew to the King of England; but his messenger
was captured by pirates, and when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
released, and proceeded on his way to the English
Court, where his proposal was accepted, it was too late;
Christopher Columbus had set forth upon his venture
perilous, under the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella
of Spain, who, after much vacillation, and not a little
treachery, had agreed to father the expedition, which
consisted of three small vessels. These were the <i>Santa
Maria</i>, on which Columbus himself sailed, the <i>Pinta</i>,
commanded by Martin Alonzo Pinzon, and the <i>Nina</i>,
captained by Pinzon&#8217;s brother, Vincente Yanez Pinzon.</p>

<p>After receiving the blessing of the Church, the expedition
set sail from Palos with a pressed crew, for few
men could be found willing to embark on such a
desperate venture. In less than a week they were compelled
to put in at the Canaries to refit the ships, which
had been buffeted about by adverse winds and stormy
seas. When this work was done, Columbus set out
again, despite the murmurings of his pressed crew, who
often cast longing eyes back to the East, hardly daring
to think of what might await them in the West, whither
men had not ventured before. The unknown held dread
terrors for them, and at every league they became more
disaffected, so that Columbus found it necessary to keep
two reckonings&mdash;one correct, for himself, and the other
incorrect, for the satisfaction of the crews. His own
showed the real distance from home; theirs showed them
that they were nearer home than they had imagined
themselves to be.</p>

<p>Two hundred leagues west of the Canaries a ship&#8217;s
mast was seen floating, and the frightened crews became
more scared than ever; they took it for a portent of their
own fate. Then the needle of the compass showed a
variation; it ceased to point to the North Star, and this
was the most dreadful thing of all to these men, who
knew nothing of hemispheres. Columbus did his utmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to cheer and inspire them with confidence, telling them
of the glory that awaited them when the voyage was
over, and assuring them that they could not be a very
long way from land. As if to prove him true, next day,
September 14, two birds hovered round the ships; later
weeds were seen floating on the surface of a kind that
grow on river banks and among rocks; then, later still,
more birds were seen&mdash;birds that they knew never slept
on the sea. And all these things seemed to be heralds
of land.</p>

<p>So the dissatisfied crew took heart again, and, with
a steady breeze helping them, the ships sped on their
unknown way, every man eagerly looking out across
the vast sea in the hope of being the first to sight the
land, the reward for which was to be a pension.</p>

<p>But as day succeeded day, and no land was seen,
the spirits of the adventurers drooped, and when they
ran into a vast sea of weeds, which made it difficult for
the vessels to hold on their way, all hopes of ever
reaching home again were dashed to the ground. Then
the wind dropped, and the ships were becalmed. Never
did Fate play so scurvy a trick with a mariner as it
did with Columbus, who knew that the success of his
voyage&mdash;the great ambition of his life&mdash;depended upon
the men who sailed with him. He heard their murmurings,
knew that it would not be long before they broke
out into open mutiny; but still he would not swerve
from his purpose.</p>

<p>Then one day they came to him with determination
in their eyes and black murder in their hearts. They
would go back, they said; they would venture no farther
on this mad voyage which could lead to nowhere but
death. They had, indeed, made up their minds to pitch
him overboard if he would not turn the ship about and
go home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Columbus, firm in his own belief that land lay to
the west, and determined that he would not turn back
until he had seen it, stood before the mutineers boldly.
He argued with them, coaxed them, even bullied them,
vowed he would hold on to the course he had mapped
out. Then, seeing that he must temporise, he promised
that, if they would stand by him for three more days,
he would turn back if no land were discovered. He
gained his point; the crew returned to their duties, and,
by the greatest good luck, shortly afterwards new signs
of land came to cheer the men.</p>

<p>Besides a quantity of fresh weeds, such as grow in
rivers, they saw a green fish of a kind that keeps about
rocks, then a branch of thorn with berries on it, and
recently separated from the tree, floated by them. Then
they picked up a reed, a small board, and, above all,
a staff, artificially carved.</p>

<p>And where there had been mutiny and threats there
was now discipline and rejoicing; and no man murmured,
or thought of the distance they had come. All
were eager to be the first to catch sight of the land they
believed to be near. Columbus himself, overwhelmed
with joy at the thought that triumph was at hand, did
not sleep that night, and had the ships hove to, lest
they miss the land in the night darkness. On each
vessel every man was wide awake, straining his
eyes through the darkness. At about one o&#8217;clock
Columbus thought that he saw a light shining in
the west, far away from the ships. He immediately
pointed it out to; the men on his vessel; but with
one exception they attached little importance to it.
They thought themselves fools when, an hour later,
a sailor cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Land! Land!&#8221; And, pointing, showed them a
dim outline on the horizon. Daylight came, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
it clearer vision; and before them stretched a low, tree-covered
island.</p>

<p>The sight of it drove them almost wild with joy.
Here, after weeks of voyaging through seas unknown,
they had come to land, when they had told themselves
there was no land to be found, when they had harboured
thoughts of murder against the man who led them.
They threw themselves on deck at his feet, and implored
his forgiveness; and Columbus knew that he had
these men fast in his grip, that they would follow him
anywhere.</p>

<p>As for himself, his pleasure knew no bounds; all the
dreams of the years were to be fulfilled, all his hopes
were to be realised, the glory of reaching Asia via the
west was to be his. Had he but known! Had he but
realised that something even greater than this had been
achieved; that near at hand lay a vast continent undreamt
of by his fellows, despite the tradition that the
Norsemen had hundreds of years before found a country
to the west, far north from this spot.</p>

<p>On October 12, 1492, Columbus, in all the glory of
his official robes as representative of the majesty of
Spain, landed on the island with his men and the officials
sent by the King to give authority to the expedition.
The Royal Standard of Spain was planted, and the
adventurer fell upon his knees, kissed the ground, and
declared the land to belong to the dominions of the
Spanish sovereigns.</p>

<p>The island was inhabited, and from the natives
Columbus learned that it was named Guanahani. The
Spaniards renamed it San Salvador&mdash;its present name.
It is one of the group known as the Bahamas, at the
entrance of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>The natives themselves, when they saw the strange
ships coming towards the island, fled, not knowing what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
they might be, for never had they seen anything
like them. As they were not pursued, however, they
plucked up enough courage to come back, and very
soon were making friends with the new-comers, who,
thinking they were on one of the islands off the coast
of India, called the natives Indians&mdash;the name still
borne by the aborigines of the New World.</p>

<p>Almost every one of the natives was bedecked with
ornaments made of gold; and the Spaniards were eager
to find out whence the metal came. The natives told
them by signs that it came from the south&mdash;far away;
and the three vessels were presently ploughing the seas
again, exploring the coast of San Salvador, by the aid
of several guides. Other islands were seen in the neighbourhood,
and these, too, were explored, Columbus
believing that they tallied with Marco Polo&#8217;s description
of certain islands lying off China. But no trace of gold
was found; each time the natives pointed them to the
south, and referred to a great king, whom Columbus
imagined to be the Great Khan.</p>

<p>Then one day he gathered that near at hand was a
great island called Cuba, and from the description given
him believed it to be Cipango (Japan), which reports
had credited with vast riches&mdash;gold and precious stones.
So to Cuba the three ships sailed, reaching the island
at the end of October, and taking possession of it in
the name of the King of Spain.</p>

<p>Here the natives, after a time, received him kindly,
and the answers to the sign-questions he put to them
made him more convinced than ever that this was
Cipango. He therefore searched it, seeking for the
Great Khan; but at last gave up in despair, and sailed
off to discover other islands. At this time Martin
Pinzon, in the <i>Pinta</i>, deserted him, and, although
Columbus waited many days for his return, he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
come back; and when, in December, Columbus set sail,
he went with only two ships. On December 6 they
sighted a large island, which, because of its beauty and
similarity with Spain, they named Hispaniola. Here,
again the natives were friendly, and parted with many
of their gold ornaments in exchange for little trinkets
the mariners had brought with them. What filled them
with joy that they could hardly contain was the news
that the island abounded in riches. Gold, they were
told, was to be obtained in plenty; and Columbus, who
had taken the island in the name of Spain, resolved,
when misfortune robbed him of another of his ships,
to leave some of his men behind to learn the language
of the natives, trade with them for gold, and explore the
island for gold mines.</p>

<p>The disaster, which left him with only one ship,
occurred through negligence. The <i>Santa Maria</i> was
wrecked, and Columbus and his crew only escaped with
great difficulty. By hard work they managed to get all
the goods and guns out of her before she went to
pieces, and with the latter Columbus built a fort for
the security of the men he intended to leave behind,
calling it La Navidad.</p>

<p>Then, on January 4, 1493, Columbus set sail from
Hispaniola in the smallest of the vessels he had come
out with, namely, the <i>Nina</i>, steering eastward along
the coast. Presently he fell in with Pinzon, whom he
reproved for his desertion. Pinzon asserted that he had
been separated in a storm, but actually he had left
Columbus, intending to return home and claim the
honours that were due to his leader. Columbus, however,
rather than have bitterness aroused, hid his anger,
and the two ships sailed in company until February 1,
when a terrific gale separated them again.</p>

<p>So dreadful was the storm that Columbus despaired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of ever reaching home with his wonderful news; and
many were the vows taken as to what the mariners
would do if Heaven spared them. Lots were cast as
to who should undertake a pilgrimage to Our Lady
of Guadalope, and it fell to Columbus. But the storm
still held on. Then they all vowed to go in their
shirts to a church of Our Lady, if she would vouchsafe
them a safe voyage home.</p>

<p>The poor <i>Nina</i>, tossed about, seemed as though she
would turn over at every big wave that broke upon her;
all her provision casks were empty, and so she was in a
poor way through lack of ballast. Columbus solved that
problem by filling the casks with water, which steadied
the ship, and enabled her to ride out the storm, during
which Columbus had been afraid lest he should never
reach Spain with the wonderful news of his discovery.
He therefore wrote down an account on parchment,
which he signed and sealed, wrapped in oilcloth and
wax, and consigned to the deep in a cask. Another copy
was packed in a similar way, and set upon the top of the
poop, so that if the <i>Nina</i> went down the cask might
float and stand a chance of carrying its precious contents
to some port, or be picked up by some ship. But,
fortunately, the storm eased off, and presently they
reached harbour at St. Mary&#8217;s, one of the Azores.</p>

<p>The mariners, exhausted after their struggle with
the storm, but grateful for having been able to come
through it, saw a hermitage on a hill, and resolved that
some of them should undertake a pilgrimage of thanks
at once. So half the ship&#8217;s crew went ashore in their
shirts, carrying candles; but hardly had they landed
when the Portuguese Governor of St. Mary&#8217;s came
down with a large body of soldiers and took them
prisoners. The Portuguese were jealous of the great
sailor, and what he had achieved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Columbus was angry at this treachery. He vowed
that if his men were not given back to him, he would
land the rest and sack the whole island. The Governor
gave in.</p>

<p>Leaving these inhospitable shores, the mariners
sailed away for home, only to meet with another storm
which caused them to make more vows. Then the
sailors worked hard, and managed to get the ship running
before the storm, which drove her into the Tagus.</p>

<p>Forced to take shelter in another Portuguese port,
therefore, this time Lisbon, Columbus went ashore,
where the King of Portugal received him with many
expressions of delight and congratulation, though beneath
the smiling face was a jealous heart. Portugal
had taken so great a part&mdash;had been the pioneer, in
fact&mdash;of the exploration of the century, that the king
felt that this accomplishment of Columbus was a personal
affront! His counsellors advised him that the
best thing to do was to kill Columbus and his men out
of hand, and, taking his charts, send an expedition out
to take possession of the new lands.</p>

<p>King John, however, would not consent to the murder
of Columbus, whom he dismissed; and then ordered
his own mariners to hurry off with an expedition to
take by force of arms the lands which had been discovered
for Spain. It may be said that when the question
of ownership of these lands was laid before the
Pope of Rome, that arbiter of the fate of people and
nations in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese were
made to understand that Spain had the prior claim on
the new territory.</p>

<p>It was on March 15 that Columbus arrived at Palos,
less than eight months after he had set out from that
port on a voyage from which few ever believed he
would return. And now, here he was! Great crowds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
met him and hailed him, and marched in procession
with him to the church, where he gave thanks to Heaven
for the success of his voyage. Then, he sent a letter
to the king, who commanded him to attend Court, where
he was received with all due honour, and told his wonderful
story which thrilled the king and queen, and
soon set all Spain by the ears. He had brought many
evidences of the truth of his tale, including several
natives and many gold ornaments; and according to the
terms of the engagement entered into, he was appointed
Governor-General of all the lands discovered. Then,
still believing that he had found the way to the East,
he went out again on September 25, 1493, discovering
new islands, and going to Hispaniola, which he found
was rich with gold. His fort had been destroyed,
however, and his men killed by the natives. With his
adventures during this voyage we have no time to deal.
There was dissatisfaction amongst some of his followers,
and accusations were made against him which necessitated
his going back to Spain to clear himself, which he
succeeded in doing. In 1498 he was allowed to go out
again, and it was on this voyage that he discovered the
mainland of America, although he never knew it. First
he landed on an island which he called Trinidad (its
present name), in honour of the Holy Trinity, and
from there he could see land, which, believing it to be
an island, he called Isla Santa (Holy Island). It was,
as a matter of fact, the mainland of America. He
went down the coast as far as Grenada, and began to
think that the length of it pointed to the fact that it
was more than an island: that it must be the mainland
of Asia.</p>

<p>Passing over the trials of Columbus which followed
upon the accusations made against him at Court, we
must go on to a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his fourth and last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
voyage. On this, which started from Cadiz in May,
1502, he went seeking a strait by which he could
get farther east. He reached Honduras, then later,
Veragua and Nicaragua, the farthest point reached being
El Retrete, when he sailed for Veragua again, thence
to Hispaniola. Many troubles beset him. Jealous followers
brought him sorrows; disorders at Hispaniola
brought him displeasure at Court, and he sailed for
home, reaching Spain in November, 1504, to die two
years later in neglect; &#8220;no local annals mention even
his death.&#8221; And he, the greatest mariner who had
ever lived, the man who had brought to Spain&mdash;although
no one realised it then&mdash;a New World, with all its
treasures.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SOME EARLY BUCCANEERS</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Beginning of Buccaneering</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE buccaneers were educated in a hard school.
From being peaceful hunters in the woods of
Hispaniola they developed into hunters on the seas,
seeking more valuable game than oxen. They took up
this new profession from a sense of being ill-treated,
and primarily with the object of obtaining vengeance.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century there
were on the island of Hispaniola a number of Frenchmen
who lived by buccaneering&mdash;a word derived from
the Indian word <i>boucan</i>, meaning, first, the hut in which
the flesh of oxen was smoked, and, secondly, the
wooden frame on which the meat was dried. Eventually
the hunters themselves received the name of
buccaneers, from which it will be seen that there was
nothing sinister in the name or profession at the outset.
In course of time larger numbers of Frenchmen gathered
at Hispaniola to follow the wild industry, and the
Spanish rulers of the island came to the conclusion that
they would rid Hispaniola of them.</p>

<p>The buccaneers at the best were not an inviting-looking
crowd, nor were they the most gentle of men.
Their mode of life made them rough and wild, and
their attire gave them an appearance of ruffianism.
Long blouses or shirts, covered with grease and blood-stains,
and held in at the waist by strips of green hide;
short drawers that reached only half-way down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
thigh, sandals of hog&#8217;s skin or bull&#8217;s hide; short guns,
called &#8220;buccaneering-pieces,&#8221; slung from their shoulders,
short sabres from their waists, calabash powder-horns
and skin bullet pouches hanging at either side,
with mosquito nets rolled up at the waist&mdash;imagine
men thus rigged out, with unkempt hair and not too
clean a skin, and you have buccaneers in all their glory.
Certainly they were not calculated to inspire confidence
when one met a little band of about a dozen out
hunting, with dogs following the quarry. But, at any
rate, they were comparatively peaceful&mdash;except when,
after a successful hunt, and a still more successful piece
of trading by which they got rid of their spoils, they
were out on a carousal.</p>

<p>Now, as we have suggested, the Spaniards grew
jealous of the growing prosperity of the buccaneers;
had the latter been Spanish, all would have been well,
but the Dons, ever since the New World had been discovered
for King Ferdinand, had sought to keep it and
its wealth for themselves; so that, when the Frenchmen
on Hispaniola grew in numbers and wealth, it seemed
to the Spaniards a case for repressive measures. They
therefore instituted mounted patrols of lancers, armed
with lances. There were some four hundred of these,
and their work was to harry the buccaneers as much and
as often as possible.</p>

<p>This warfare between the lancers and the buccaneers
went on for many years; but the Spaniards found that
the hunters refused to be intimidated; and if the truth
were known, they probably enjoyed the occasional bout
with the Spaniards. In any case, they would not give
up their hunting for all the lancers in Hispaniola. The
Spaniards therefore resorted to other means. If the
buccaneers would not go, then their livelihood should
be taken from them, and the powers that were in Spain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
sent orders for the destruction of all the wild cattle
in Hispaniola.</p>

<p>The orders were carried out to the letter, and the
buccaneers, finding themselves without the means of
living and trade, shook the dust of Hispaniola from
their feet, and in 1637 made their way to the island of
Tortuga, about six miles to the north of Hispaniola.
There their already large numbers were increased by
the coming of a cosmopolitan crowd of ruffians, till,
feeling themselves strong enough, they determined to
take vengeance on Spain for having cast them adrift.</p>

<p>They fell upon Hispaniola, not once nor twice, but
time after time, until the Dons came to the conclusion
that Tortuga must be under the yoke of Spain and the
buccaneers be swept away. So, timing their descent
well, they went over to Tortuga when the French
were away on the mainland, hunting, and the English
were far off on a cruise. Landing soldiers, they took
the island within an hour, seizing a large number of
hunters before they had time to defend themselves.
Some they killed out of hand, others they made captive,
but a good many succeeded in escaping to certain
hiding-places, whence, with the coming of night, they
slipped down to the shore and hurried off to the mainland
in canoes.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, feeling that this vigorous action
would be sufficient to keep Tortuga within bounds,
sailed back to Hispaniola. But, instead of having
quashed the buccaneers, they found that they had but
added fuel to the fire, for when the rovers came back
from cruising and hunting, and discovered the condition
of their island, they were filled with anger. They went
mad! Off to the French island of St. Christopher they
sailed, and Governor De Poncy, falling in with their
plans, sent an expedition to Tortuga, which was recaptured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and put in such a state of defence that the
disillusioned Dons had a shock next time they went over
to carry out a second attempt at terrorism. Two hundred
Spaniards bit the dust that day, and the buccaneer&mdash;the
real buccaneer&mdash;was born.</p>

<p>For the Spaniard was successful in his efforts to kill
the hunters&#8217; trade; he stamped out the trading-hunter
and gave life to a particularly romantic kind of pirate-freebooter.
The men of Tortuga fell to preying upon
the shipping of Spain. They were determined to have
their revenge.</p>

<p>It would appear from all accounts that the first
successful buccaneer who took to sea-roving was one
Pierre le Grand, a native of Dieppe, who had found his
way to the New World in quest of fortune. Baffled in
his attempts to make the smiling lands yield up their
wealth, he gathered a congenial company about him, and
went to sea in a small boat holding himself and a crew
of twenty men. The exploit that made him famous
was that by which he captured the vice-admiral of a
Spanish fleet near Cape of Tiburon, to the west of
Hispaniola.</p>

<p>They had, it seems, been at sea a good while on the
look-out for a prize worth having, and, finding none,
were getting disheartened&mdash;and hungry, incidentally,
seeing that they had used up most of their rations.
Then, like a gift from the gods, there came into view
a Spanish fleet, with a large ship standing some distance
off from the rest. Pierre decided that it would be
impious to let such an opportunity slip. He knew that
it was a case of long odds, because the Spaniard was
a fine vessel, and no doubt well manned; but, nothing
venture, nothing have! So, waiting until the dusk of
evening, Pierre, who had received solemn oaths from
his companions that they would stand by him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
last, sailed towards his prey, hoping in his heart that
the Dons might be unprepared for battle.</p>

<p>He did not know it then, but later he found out that
the captain of the ship had had the little cockle-boat
pointed out to him, with the suggestion that it might
be a pirate craft; whereupon the gallant sailor had
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, then, must I be afraid of such a pitiful thing
as that is? No! though she were a ship as big and as
strong as mine is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Determined to hazard all upon a gambler&#8217;s throw,
when Peter drew near the great Spaniard, under cover
of the twilight, he made his surgeon bore holes in the
sides of his boat, so that, with their own vessel sinking
quickly beneath them, his men might be impelled to
put all their energy into the attempt to board the Spanish
ship.</p>

<p>So, with &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; as the unspoken battle-cry,
the buccaneers swarmed up the sides of the ship, hurled
themselves aboard without being seen, and rushed pell-mell
to the captain&#8217;s cabin, where they found him playing
cards.</p>

<p>Pierre le Grand held the trump card&mdash;in the shape of
a loaded pistol, which he promptly presented at the
captain&#8217;s head, calling upon him to surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus bless us!&#8221; cried the Spaniard. &#8220;Are these
devils, or what are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>The uninvited guests showed what they were; while
Peter the Great kept the captain quiet, others rushed to
the gun-room, seized all the arms, and then dispersed
about the ship, taking prisoner whoever preferred that
to being killed out of hand. There was no gainsaying
them, and the captain gave in, with the result that Pierre
found himself master of a fine ship filled with treasure,
and a crew that he hardly knew what to do with. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
solved the problem by setting ashore all he didn&#8217;t want,
and the rest he kept on to sail the ship to France. For
the gay buccaneer discovered that he was rich enough
to retire, and never again showed his face in the New
World.</p>

<p>But if he did no more pirating himself, he set fire
to the buccaneers of Tortuga, who told themselves that
what Pierre le Grand had done they could do. If they
had but ships! They were going to set up in &#8220;business&#8221;
that required good craft, and there they were
with only canoes. Well, canoes would do to get them
where they could find suitable ships, and, pushing off
day after day, the buccaneers cruised about Hispaniola
and the neighbourhood, seizing small Spanish vessels
carrying tobacco and hides. These they took back to
Tortuga, disposed of the cargoes profitably, fitted out
the vessels, and set out to sea again, now to seek larger
ships; with the result that, in a couple of years, a score
of buccaneer ships were sailing the seas proudly, taking
toll of the Spaniards for having stopped their peaceful
livelihood.</p>

<p>Of these earlier buccaneers we must mention another
Peter&mdash;Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois. Like Peter the Great, his forerunner,
he had been cruising about a long time without
a satisfactory prize turning up; and as away at Tortuga
were a number of men&mdash;whom we, in these modern
days, call &#8220;duns&#8221;&mdash;waiting for him to settle up various
little accounts, he thought it behoved him, for his
creditors&#8217; sake, to garner a harvest that was worth while.</p>

<p>So, standing out from the neighbourhood of
Hispaniola, Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois ventured farther afield.
Away down at Ranceiras, near the River Plate, there
was a fine rich bank of pearl, to which year after year
the Spaniards sent about a dozen large ships a-pearling,
each squadron having a man-o&#8217;-war to protect it.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Promptly boarded the <i>Vice-Admiral</i>. &#8216;Surrender!&#8217; yelled the buccaneers&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois felt he would like to have some of
the pearls which other men had obtained. When he
came up with the fleet, he found the warship, the
<i>Capitana</i>, of twenty-four guns and a couple of hundred
men, lying half a league away from the rest of the
vessels; and, well versed in the ways of the wily
Spaniard, he knew that the man-o&#8217;-war would be certain
to hold the greater part of the harvest of the sea. Wherefore,
of course, Pierre decided that nothing less than
the <i>Capitana</i> would pay him for the trip down the coast.</p>

<p>But first he must put himself in the way of being
strong enough to take the war vessel, and to this end he
resolved to capture one of the other ships to begin with.
Pretending that his ship was a Spanish craft, he pulled
down his sails, rowed close to the shore till he reached
the pearl-bank, and then promptly boarded the <i>Vice-Admiral</i>,
of eight guns and threescore men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender!&#8221; yelled the buccaneers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried the Spaniards, and fell to fighting
stubbornly; and then did what they said they wouldn&#8217;t
do&mdash;they surrendered.</p>

<p>So far so good. Pierre was elated. But he did
want that man-o&#8217;-war!</p>

<p>First he sank his own vessel, which was in a pretty
bad way. Then he hoisted the Spanish flag on his prize
and sailed away. The captain of the <i>Capitana</i>, fearing
that one of his convoy was running off with treasure&mdash;those
Spaniards never trusted each other!&mdash;set sail
after the runaway. Pierre let him come, and then, when
within hailing distance, made his prisoners yell:
&#8220;<i>Victoria! Victoria!</i> We have taken the thieves!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the <i>Capitana</i>, believing that everything
was all right, hove to, drew off, and disappeared in the
darkness, promising to send to fetch the prisoners away
in the morning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>During the night Fran&ccedil;ois decided to slip away.
Perhaps he didn&#8217;t like the look of the <i>Capitana</i> after
all; perhaps he was satisfied with his haul. He should
have been, for it contained pearls of the value of 100,000
gold pieces of eight, and a large store of provisions.
But he had come to the end of his lucky lode, for the
<i>Capitana</i>, having, apparently, grown suspicious, suddenly
hoisted sail and followed in pursuit. Pierre hoped
to be able to show a clean pair of heels before daylight
came. But Dame Fate played him a nasty trick; the
wind fell, and left him becalmed. And when dawn
broke he saw that the <i>Capitana</i>, becalmed also, lay
within sight, waiting for the wind to freshen.</p>

<p>Evening came, and with it a breeze; and instantly
Pierre hoisted all sail and stood away, with the <i>Capitana</i>
in hot pursuit. Then Pierre found he had made a
mistake; the ship was unable to bear the burden of so
much sail as he had hoisted, and the fickle wind,
bursting upon him, brought his mainsail down with
a rush.</p>

<p>That did it! The <i>Capitana</i> sped through the water
towards the <i>Vice-Admiral</i>, and, coming within range,
sent a few shots hurtling at her, expecting to see her
haul down the flag. Instead of which Pierre, resolved
to fight in the hope of coming out best, opened out with
his eight guns, and pounded away for all he was worth.
He took the precaution first of clapping his prisoners
in the hold and nailing down the hatches. And then,
with but twenty-two men fit to fight&mdash;the rest were either
killed or wounded&mdash;he prepared to give battle. For
hours they fought, bravely and well; but all in vain.
The man-o&#8217;-war was too much for them, and at last
Pierre signified his willingness to surrender&mdash;on conditions.
These were that they shouldn&#8217;t be made slaves,
nor be made to work on the plantations. The Spaniards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
agreed; and within a short time Fran&ccedil;ois and his men
were on board the Spanish vessel&mdash;prisoners.</p>

<p>They were taken to Carthagena, where the Spaniards
broke their word, and made the prisoners slaves for three
years, after which they were sent to Spain.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Portugues, another of the early
buccaneers, sailing off Cuba in a small vessel of three
guns and thirty men, fell to chasing a big Spaniard of
twenty big guns and seventy men. The Spaniards
showed fight, and beat Bartholomew off with losses he
could ill afford. But, determined to succeed or die, the
buccaneer brought his vessel back again, and, getting
alongside, led his crew aboard the Spanish ship. All
fighting like demons, in the end they captured it, and
found themselves in possession of a vessel worth having,
with a treasure on board of 120,000 lbs. of cocoa and
75,000 crowns.</p>

<p>Joyful over their good fortune, the buccaneers
bethought themselves of returning to Jamaica, whence
they had set out; but, as they were now but twenty all
told, they did not know how to keep their prisoners.
They solved that problem by bundling them into a
small boat and turning them adrift, after which they
hoisted sail and set off to Cuba to repair, as the wind
was not favourable for Jamaica.</p>

<p>All would have gone well had they not fallen in
with three large ships bound for Havannah, which,
becoming suspicious, gave chase, and, as they were
much faster vessels than the new-found prize of the
buccaneers, they quickly overhauled it, battered at it
with their guns, and before long had made the captors
captives, with whom they set sail for Campechy.</p>

<p>Portugues had a reputation that was not warranted
to make him loved in Campechy, and when he arrived
there men lifted up their voices and cried:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Behold, this is Bartholomew Portugues, the biggest
scoundrel in the world, who has done more harm to
Spanish trade than all the other pirates put together.&#8221;
And in due course the governor, in the name of the
King of Spain, sent soldiers, who took the buccaneer
to another ship, where he was clapped into irons to
await the morning&mdash;and the gallows, which were
promptly erected. Bartholomew, made aware of the
preparations being made in his honour, considered it
necessary to do something on his own account for his
safety. So in the night he freed himself from his
shackles, and, being ingenious and a non-swimmer,
fashioned strange water-wings, in the shape of a couple
of leathern jars he found in his cabin. Then, having
waited till silence on the ship told him that everyone
was asleep&mdash;excepting, he surmised, the sentry at his
door&mdash;he resolved to make a bid for freedom. The
sentry he stabbed with a knife he had concealed, and
then slipped over the ship&#8217;s side, clambered down the
mainchains into the sea, and, supported by his jars,
made his way to shore.</p>

<p>Into the woods he darted, and for three days hid
there, on a diet of wild herbs, listening to the sounds
of baying bloodhounds and angry citizens seeking him
high and low. Fortunately for the buccaneer, his place
of concealment was in a hollow tree partly covered by
water, which put the bloodhounds off the scent.</p>

<p>In due course the searchers became convinced that
the pirate had eluded them, and gave up the search,
and Bartholomew decided it was safe to venture forth.
He wanted to get to Gulfo Triste, 160 miles away, and
thither he bent his steps. It was a long way and a weary
way, and a hungry and thirsty way, too, for he had no
provisions and little water. He came to rivers that
he must cross, and he had no boats. He found a board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
with a few old nails in it, and out of these he fashioned
crude knives, with which he laboriously cut down
branches of trees, and made a raft by which to cross
the rivers. Sometimes the rivers were fordable, but
were filled with alligators. At these he flung stones to
scare them away, and then sallied forth across the
stream. Once a mangrove swamp lay between him and
the place where he would fain go. There was no road;
only the swamp, that would swallow him up if he put
foot upon it. He solved the problem of progress by
swinging from bough to bough of the mangrove, travelling
for miles in that way. Truly, Bartholomew was
a hardy traveller!</p>

<p>Thus for a whole fortnight the buccaneer kept on
his lonely way, and at last reached Gulfo Triste, where
he found what he had hoped would be there&mdash;a
buccaneer ship, careening.</p>

<p>The pirates were friends of his, and he poured into
their attentive ears the story of his adventures and
misadventures. They listened even more attentively
when he told them that, if they would help him, he
would put in their way a ship that would enable them
to brave any vessel that the Spanish Dons might send
out against them; besides which it contained goodly
treasures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a boat and thirty men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
I will go back to Campechy and bring back the ship
that took me prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>His friends gave the boat and the men, and
Bartholomew set out, hugging the coast, and eight days
later came to Campechy. Then, under the cover of
darkness, he put his boat alongside the great vessel,
scrambled up her side, and prepared to rush. The
sentry challenged him. Bartholomew, in Spanish,
murmured soothingly that they were part of the crew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
returning, after an evening ashore, with smuggled
goods, and the sentry kept quiet. He was quieter still
soon, for a knife-thrust laid him low.</p>

<p>Then, with a rush, the buccaneers fell upon the
watch, overpowered them, cut the cable and set the
vessel adrift; after which they ran below. The sleeping
crew awoke in a great fright, and, with pistols at
their heads, were compelled to surrender.</p>

<p>The ship was won!</p>

<p>Bartholomew, however, seemed dogged by hard
luck, for while he was making his way past the Isle
of Pines, bound for Jamaica, a great storm burst upon
him, and drove his prize upon the rocks, where she
held fast until she was broken to pieces.</p>

<p>The ship was lost!</p>

<p>The buccaneers, however, succeeded in escaping to
Jamaica in a canoe, from where, according to Esquemeling,
the chronicler of the dark deeds of the bold pirates,
&#8220;it was not long before Bartholomew Portugues went
on new adventures, but was never fortunate afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MORGAN: BUCCANEER AND GOVERNOR</h2>


<p class="ph1">Tales of the Remarkable Exploits of the Greatest
Buccaneer</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE telling the story of the buccaneer who
became Governor of Jamaica, we must mention
the change which had taken place in the methods of
the buccaneers. From being mere rovers of the sea, bent
on taking toll of shipping, they had developed into a
brotherhood which made bold attempts on cities. The
Spaniards, weary of their depredations and finding that
they could not cope with them, had reduced the amount
of shipping, so that the buccaneers had to turn to more
profitable fields of enterprise. Hence, says Esquemeling,
&#8220;the pirates finding not so many ships at sea as
before, began to gather into greater companies, and
land upon the Spanish dominions, ruining whole cities,
towns and villages; and withal pillaging, burning, and
carrying away as much as they could find possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now to Captain Henry Morgan, the most
famous of the buccaneers. He was a Welshman, who,
after various little &#8220;affairs,&#8221; found himself in command
of a pirate vessel, with which he was successful. Later,
he allied himself with Mansvelt, a notorious buccaneer,
and after the death of that worthy, Morgan was appointed
to the command of the Brethren of the Coast.</p>

<p>At the head of his band of rogues, he captured the
towns of Port au Prince, Cuba, and Porto Bello, Panama&mdash;both
after stiff fights&mdash;and from the latter he extracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a heavy ransom, was cheeky to the governor
of Panama, after he had waylaid and beaten an expedition
sent out to wipe him off the Spanish main, and
promised the governor that he would come later and
sack his city for him!</p>

<p>Then he turned his attention to Maracaibo.</p>

<p>First of all, he held a review of his force; it consisted
of eight ships and five hundred men, quite a
formidable little army. With these he sailed, and in
due course arrived off Maracaibo. The buccaneers held
off till night came, sailing in under cover of the
darkness until they arrived near the bar. The Spaniards,
sighting the strange vessels, were taking no risks, and
opened fire immediately, pounding away at the pirates
as they put out their boats and manned them, ready
to sweep in and land. Of course, Morgan&#8217;s ships gave
the Spaniards as much as they received, and during
the day a fine little fight was kept up. Then night came
again; and Morgan, meaning to take advantage of it,
swooped in, to find that the Spaniards in the fort had
bolted precipitately when night fell.</p>

<p>They had taken the precaution, however, of setting a
fuse train to a barrel of gunpowder, sufficient to hurl
the fort and the buccaneers into the Great Unknown.
Fortunately, Morgan&#8217;s men, scouring about for such a
likely thing, hit upon it in about a quarter of an hour,
and soon destroyed the fuse.</p>

<p>That done, the fort was ransacked and demolished.
Next day, free from hindrance of the fort, the eight
pirate ships passed into the harbour, and went on
to Maracaibo. The water, however, being too shallow
to allow of the ships passing up, the buccaneers took
to small boats and canoes, and in this way made their
way to the town. Landing, they immediately rushed
Fort De la Barra, only to find that it was deserted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the Spaniards here had fled like their comrades farther
down, as also had the people in the town, with the
exception of a few old folk.</p>

<p>Truly, Morgan was having an easy time.</p>

<p>Searching the town to make sure that there were no
soldiers hidden in the houses to open fire upon them
as they passed through the streets, and finding none,
the buccaneers dispersed about the city, some taking up
their abode in the church, for nothing was held sacred
to these terrible scourgers of the sea and sackers of
cities.</p>

<p>Although Morgan captured a number of fugitives
and a good deal of booty, he realised that there was
nothing much to be gained from Maracaibo, and decided
to assault Gibraltar. First he sent a batch of
prisoners to the city, to warn the inhabitants that they
must surrender, or else they would receive no quarter;
and almost immediately followed them with his ships.
Gibraltar, however, was determined not to surrender at
the behest of a scoundrelly buccaneer, and Morgan was
met by a terrific cannonading.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, the buccaneers accepted their welcome
philosophically, counting it but the bitters before
the sweets. Early next morning, they landed and
marched on the town, taking the safe route through the
woods, the Spaniards in the fort little expecting them
to come by that way. However, the dons, aware of the
reputation of Morgan, had followed the example of their
compatriots at Maracaibo and had fled, leaving only
one old man to receive the buccaneers. They had taken
all the munitions of war, all the treasure, and as much
of their goods as they could cope with, and they had
spiked all the guns.</p>

<p>There were a number of murderous and cruel incidents
connected with the prisoners they succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
taking later on. From one of these unfortunate men
they learned of a certain river where there was a richly
laden ship and four boats filled with treasure; he also
told them that he knew where the governor of Gibraltar
was hidden.</p>

<p>This was good news. Morgan went off with a large
force to capture the governor, and sent another body of
men to take the ship and the boats. Morgan was unsuccessful
in capturing the governor, who had heard of
his coming and had taken up a strong position on a
mountain; so that the buccaneer had to forgo the
pleasure of capturing him, and, moreover, had to make
a perilous retreat, owing to the fact that the rains had
come and the ground was swampy&mdash;sometimes, indeed,
the men had to wade waist deep. Many female prisoners
and children died of exposure; some of the buccaneers
died also, and all their powder was wet and useless,
so that, if the Spaniards had had the gumption of mice,
they would have fallen upon Morgan and utterly routed
him. But they hadn&#8217;t; and they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Morgan, therefore, arrived safely back at Gibraltar,
where two days later his other men turned up, bringing
the four boats and some prisoners, but little treasure.
The Spaniards had taken it out of the ship and the
boats.</p>

<p>Having held Gibraltar for five weeks, and having
committed all sorts of cruelties to extract treasure from
the prisoners taken, Morgan decided that it was time to
be moving. He first of all sent prisoners into the woods
to collect a ransom for the city, failing which the place
would be burnt out. The searchers came back minus
ransom; they could not find anyone who would give
them money, they said. Morgan was furious; but the
inhabitants begged him to allow them time, offering
to give themselves up as hostages. Morgan, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
anxious to get back to Maracaibo before the Spaniards
had had time to refortify it, agreed to this, and eventually
sailed away, taking a goodly treasure with him and
all the slaves he had captured.</p>

<p>Reaching Maracaibo, he found that the Spaniards
had not yet come back, but learned from an old man
that three Spanish men-o&#8217;-war were lying at the entrance
to the river, waiting for him, and that the fort
had been repaired. Here was a pretty pass! Safety
lay in getting out, and three battleships were hovering
about!</p>

<p>Morgan, however, like the bold adventurer he was,
refused to regard himself as caught. He sent a messenger
to the admiral of the Spanish ships, Don Alonzo
del Campo d&#8217;Espinosa, with an ultimatum!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ransom of 20,000 pieces of eight for Maracaibo,
or I&#8217;ll burn the city!&#8221; was the trend of that ultimatum;
as though Morgan were master of the situation.</p>

<p>The messenger came back, bringing a letter from
d&#8217;Espinosa, informing Morgan that, seeing his commission
was to secure the buccaneers, and as he had
a good backing of ships, besides the repaired fort, he
would see Morgan to the deuce before he took any
notice of the latter&#8217;s ultimatum. He made one concession,
however; that if Morgan would refund all he had
taken, and quit the Spanish Main for England, he
would allow him to pass freely. Otherwise, the
Spaniards would give fight, and put every buccaneer
to the sword.</p>

<p>Morgan read the letter, said a few strong things
about Spaniards in general and d&#8217;Espinosa in particular,
and then called a council of his men in the
market-place of Maracaibo, and was gratified to know
that they would all stand by him in a vigorous offensive
against the Spaniards. One of them propounded a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
scheme for destroying the Spanish vessels. Fireships!
That was the suggestion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their determination to fight, the
buccaneers had another try at corrupting d&#8217;Espinosa.
They sent saying that they would compromise by doing
no damage to the town, or exact ransom from it;
and that they would release half the slaves taken, all
other prisoners, and forgo any ransom from Gibraltar,
if the Spaniards would allow them to pass through unmolested.
D&#8217;Espinosa, of course, refused the terms,
and gave the buccaneers two days to fall into line with
his own suggestion. He would have done better if he
had attacked them out of hand, for Morgan immediately
began to put himself in fighting form. He secured his
prisoners, had all arms prepared, and then fixed up a
fireship. She was drenched with tar and brimstone, logs
of wood were placed upright on her decks, surmounted
by hats, to resemble men; dummy cannons were fixed
in her portholes and on her decks.</p>

<p>All being ready, they went down the river to seek
the Spaniards, the fireship leading the way. At night
they came within sight of the enemy, dropped anchor,
determined to fight all night if the Spaniards attacked.
But morning came, and the foe had not opened the
battle, so Morgan opened it instead. He sent the
fireship ahead; she grappled the admiral&#8217;s ship, and
almost simultaneously burst into flame. Instantly there
was confusion on the Spanish ship, which tried to cut
herself free. But in vain; the flames caught her rigging
and canvas, even her timber, so that within a very
short time the stern of the ship was ablaze, the forepart
sank, and the great ship perished. Meanwhile, the other
Spaniards were horror-stricken; one ship ran for the
shelter of the fort&mdash;anywhere to get away from such a
fate; the Spaniards sank her themselves rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
that she should fall to the foe. The third ship was
attacked by the buccaneers and captured; and Morgan
knew that his bold plan had been successful.</p>

<p>The buccaneers, gladdened at their victory, landed,
with the intention of assaulting the fort; but, finding
it well armed and manned, and they themselves having
only small pieces with them, thought discretion the
better part of valour for the time, though they had a
little fight with the Spaniards, just for fun, which cost
them thirty men dead and as many wounded. The
Dons, fearing another attack both by land and sea,
entrenched themselves during the night; but Morgan
was not intending to assault them again, but rather to
find a way out, for the fort still stood between him and
escape. First of all he left one ship near the scene of
the fight, to watch the vessels which had been burnt,
and which he heard contained a large treasure. Then
he returned with the prize to Maracaibo, where he refitted
her, and then went back to his other ships near
the fort.</p>

<p>Master of the situation, he now sent to the governor
demanding the ransom&mdash;now 30,000 pieces of eight and
500 cows; otherwise, the city should be burnt in eight
days. In two days the cows were forthcoming, and
20,000 pieces of eight, the ransom finally agreed upon.
Meanwhile, the governor was working hard at getting
the fort in a thorough state of repair, so that he might
dispute the passage of the pirates as they tried to force
their way through. Having salted all the meat supplied
him, Morgan asked the governor to allow him
free passage. It was refused. The buccaneer replied
by threatening to hang his prisoners in the rigging, so
that they should be shot by the fort guns as the vessels
swung past. The governor refused to budge, even when
the prisoners made a frantic appeal to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was Morgan&#8217;s answer. &#8220;If he will not
let me pass, then I&#8217;ll find a way without him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The vessel which he had left near the burnt ship had
been successful in getting many pieces of eight out of
her, and a large quantity of plate and molten gold.</p>

<p>As the governor refused him safe passage, Morgan,
having divided the booty of the expedition, amounting
to 250,000 pieces of eight and a large quantity of
merchandise, turned his attention to finding the means
whereby to escape. Fertile in invention, cool in execution,
he soon found a way. It was a bold piece of
strategy that he hit upon. On the day he had decided
to leave despite the governor, he sent boats, fully
manned, to the shore, but instead of landing, the men,
under shelter of the trees overhanging the river, simply
lay down in the boats, which were pulled back to the
ships, only to be sent off again to follow the same procedure.
The Spaniards in the fort, seeing such large
numbers of men apparently coming ashore, prepared
themselves for a fierce night attack. They therefore
mounted all their big guns on the landward side, which
was just what Morgan had hoped they would do!</p>

<p>Night came; the buccaneers weighed anchor, and
with lights out and no sails set, but trusting to the
tide, they drifted down river till they were abreast of
the castle, when they spread their sails with all haste
and made for the open sea. Instantly the Spaniards
perceived how they had been hoodwinked, and in frantic
haste moved their guns back to their original positions,
and began firing at the buccaneers, who, however,
favoured by a good breeze, were able to swing by
without receiving much damage.</p>

<p>Safely past the fort, Morgan hove to, and in the
morning sent some of his prisoners to the governor,
who dispatched boats so that the others might be sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
ashore, Morgan, however, detaining the hostages from
Gibraltar, as the city had not yet paid its ransom. Then
the buccaneers, giving the Spaniards a parting salvo of
seven great guns, dipped their flags in derision and
went away, to run into a great storm, which threatened
to do what the Spaniards had not been able to do&mdash;destroy
them. However, they rode it out, and eventually
reached Jamaica, highly pleased with themselves.</p>

<p>As was the custom with the buccaneers, Morgan&#8217;s
men soon dissipated the fortune they had made in their
raid on Maracaibo and Gibraltar, and the chief was
besieged by men who wanted him to undertake another
expedition. Nothing loath, Morgan called a council
of buccaneers at Port Couillon, on the south of
Hispaniola, on October 24, 1670. Here he propounded
a mighty big scheme, and one that had to be carefully
worked out. First, provisions were necessary, and the
buccaneers sent an expedition to the mainland to scour
for maize, while another went hunting for animals; and
when all these were obtained they met again at Port
Couillon, where the final arrangements were made.
Everything being ready, they set sail for Cape Tiburon,
where they were joined by a number of other ships,
which brought the fleet up to thirty-seven vessels and
two thousand men, all well armed, and each ship with
large guns aboard. Morgan, finding himself the leader
of such a formidable expedition, organised it properly,
forming it into two squadrons, appointing a vice-admiral
and other officers for the second squadron, he
himself leading the first.</p>

<p>Having fixed these little matters up, the buccaneers
discussed their expedition. Where should they go?
The votes fell for Panama, which was counted the richest
city to plunder. As they were not familiar with the
overland route, they decided to seize guides from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
island of St. Catherine, and in due course the armada
appeared off the fort of that place. They sent messengers
demanding its surrender, and the governor
gave in, whereupon the buccaneers busied themselves in
laying in all the stores they wanted; and that being
done, enlisted three pretty rogues to act as guides to
them in their great venture.</p>

<p>Then Morgan sent off a fairly large party to assault
the castle of Chagre, as a sort of preliminary canter;
and when this had been successfully done, he himself
went to the castle, rebuilt it, and so secured his line of
retreat&mdash;if Fate should make it necessary for him to
flee before the Spaniards at Panama. Five hundred of
his ruffians were left as a garrison, and 150 guarded the
ships, 1,200 going with Morgan when he set out for
Panama, which he did as soon as everything was ready.</p>

<p>The buccaneer received information that the
Spaniards were aware of his projected expedition, and
had prepared against it, placing ambuscades on the line
of route. But, instead of scaring Morgan, it really only
made him alter his plans to the extent that, instead of
carrying as many stores as he would have done, he
relied upon sending the Spaniards scurrying from their
ambushes, and taking their stores for himself.</p>

<p>On January 18, 1671, therefore, the buccaneers left
Chagre in boisterous spirits, with songs on their lips,
and with the good wishes of their comrades ringing in
their ears. Drums were beaten, flags waved, blunder-busses
were fired, as the intrepid 1,200 embarked in
boats and canoes.</p>

<p>Their troubles began at once. The day was hot,
the boats none too commodious to contain all the men,
and the result was that the buccaneers were sun-scorched
and cramped as they made their way up the river against
the stream, with the water lapping over the gunwales,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
so crowded were the craft. Six Spanish leagues only
were covered that first day, and when evening fell the
buccaneers scrambled ashore to seek for food. They
found little or none. Morgan had not bargained for
the Spaniards taking such effective measures to render
his expedition a failure; but the Dons had given instructions
all along the route that every particle of food
was to be removed, animals driven away, and what
could not be cleared off to be destroyed. Esquemeling
says that &#8220;this day, being the first of all their journey,
there was amongst them such scarcity of victuals that
the greatest part of them were forced to pass with only
a pipe of tobacco, without any other refreshment.&#8221; The
following day the journey was resumed, but the same
troubles beset them, and when they arrived at Cruz de
Juan Gallego, in the evening, they had to abandon their
boats and canoes, because the river was shallow and
filled with fallen trees.</p>

<p>Morgan&#8217;s guides told him that two leagues farther
on the country was good for travelling on foot, and the
buccaneer, leaving 160 men to guard the boats, set out
next morning to cut a way through the thick jungle.
The travelling was so hard that the men could not cope
with it, and, fearing lest, if they got through, they would
be worse than useless to withstand an attack, Morgan
went back to the river, determined to make a portage.
He sent the strongest of his men by land, and embarked
the remainder on the canoes, which forced a way
up river and met the other party&mdash;hungry, weary, disappointed
at not having come across either Indians or
Spaniards. They wanted food so badly, and could find
none.</p>

<p>From this point Morgan divided his army into two
parties, one going by land, the other by river, with a
guide scouting before them on the look-out for ambuscades.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Incidentally, the Spaniards also had their spies,
who were so efficient that they could warn the Spaniards
six hours before the coming of the buccaneers. It was
in this way that Morgan came to an ambuscade too late
to meet the Spaniards, 500 of whom, he judged, had
been there. Not a scrap of food was left behind; the
only things about were a few leathern bags, upon which
the buccaneers fell ravishingly, and quarrelled amongst
themselves as to the biggest shares! After they had
feasted themselves upon the tough rations, they moved
forward again, to come to another place where an
ambuscade had been made, only to find it as deserted
and as barren as the other. They searched here, there,
and everywhere for food, finding none. Not a horse,
not a cow was to be seen; they could not find even rats,
and on the fifth day they were so famished that it seemed
as though the expedition would be a failure. Then
they lighted upon a grotto, and in it found two sacks of
meal, wheat, etc., and a couple of jars of wine and some
fruits. Such heaven-sent gifts! Morgan caused them
to be distributed amongst the weakest of his men, whom
he put in the canoes, making the others go by land.</p>

<p>Next day they came to a plantation with a barn in it
filled with maize. They broke that barn open, and fell
to eating the corn raw, and then distributed the rest.
Unfortunately for them, they presently saw what they
thought was an ambuscade of Indians. They felt that
now they would be sure to find food, and, throwing their
maize away, rushed at the ambuscade; but the Indians
slipped away, carrying everything with them, and
standing on the other side of the river, taunted them,
and, shooting arrows, succeeded in killing several of the
buccaneers.</p>

<p>The way now lay across the river, and it was necessary
to wait until next day to cross. That night the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
men began to grumble, cursing Morgan for a fool, and
vowing that they would go back. However, better
counsels prevailed, and in the morning, having seen to
their arms, they crossed the river, and travelled on to
the village of Cruz. Smoke issuing from the houses
cheered them up, for they said, &#8220;Where there&#8217;s smoke,
there&#8217;s food!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they were disappointed, for the Spaniards had
fled with everything eatable and of value, setting fire to
the houses ere they left. A few cats and dogs were
found; they made a feast for the buccaneers that day.
Then some nosing scoundrel discovered a few jars of
wine and a sack of bread. They fell upon those goodies
with a will; and then almost died after drinking the
wine, which was too strong for their weakened stomachs.
This little matter delayed them till next morning, for
the men were too ill to move, and it was a case of
everyone walking now, because the river was too shallow
to take them farther. Morgan, therefore, next morning
sent his canoes back, lest they should be captured, and
with the remainder of his men marched forward, meeting
that day with the first opposition. A flight of some
four thousand arrows darkened the air, and caused a
panic amongst the buccaneers, who could not see
whence they had come. Presently, however, they espied
a band of Indians in a position which, if defended
stanchly, would have prevented the buccaneers passing.
But, contenting themselves with shooting a few
more arrows, the Indians took to their heels. Then,
a little later, the raiders met another company, and had
a stiff little fight with them. Yet again, in a wood,
Indians appeared, backed by a number of Spaniards.
These, however, soon fled, and the pirates held on their
way, experiencing in the evening and during the night
a terrific rainstorm, which caused them much hardship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
as the majority had to sleep out in the downpour, a
few being told off to occupy some small huts in which
the arms and powder were stored.</p>

<p>The ninth day came, and the buccaneers ascended
a hill, from the summit of which they caught the gleam
of the great South Sea. And, better still, fertile plains
rolled beneath them, with herds of cattle quietly
browsing.</p>

<p>Down the hill-side raced the buccaneers, hurling
themselves amongst the cattle, which they killed and
cut up for eating, many not waiting to cook the meat.</p>

<p>Having thus satisfied their animal cravings, they
moved forward, sending out a band of fifty to scout,
in the hope of being able to capture some prisoners, from
whom they might learn the disposition and strength of
the Spaniards. Morgan was growing anxious at the
elusiveness of the Dons, fearing, no doubt, that they
were simply leading him on into a well prepared trap.
But he never swerved from his intention; he had come
to take Panama and sack it, and he would do so despite
all the Spaniards in the New World. Towards evening
a couple of hundred Dons appeared and shouted at
the buccaneers, who, however, could not catch what they
said; and soon after the Spaniards had gone away the
picturesque horde of pirates came in sight of Panama.
Mighty cheers rent the air, trumpets blared, ragged caps
were flung up; the men who had found the utmost
difficulty in dragging themselves along the tortuous
paths now leaped for very joy. They already had by
anticipation the wealth of Panama in their hands!</p>

<p>They pitched their camp that night with Panama
before them, barely contenting themselves with the idea
of having to wait until the morning before the work really
began. They need not have worried; the Spaniards saw
to it that they had little rest. Fifty horsemen trooped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
out of the city, headed by a trumpeter, who blared away
at them, while the Dons cried in derision: &#8220;Come on, ye
dogs! We shall meet ye!&#8221; and then rode back, leaving
an outpost to keep an eye upon the buccaneers.
Almost immediately afterwards the great guns of
Panama began to speak <i>their</i> taunts, and the pirates
found themselves bombarded by heavy fire, which,
however, did little damage.</p>

<p>Morning came, and the raiders prepared for the
assault of the city. There was little need for silence as
they moved forward, and the buccaneers made a terrible
row, what with shouting, singing, and trumpeting.
They were an army by no means to be despised; about
a thousand strong, with loot as their aim, and what they
lacked in the way of uniform&mdash;for they were as ragamuffin
an army as ever took the field&mdash;they made up
in courage and equipment. On they went, and then
suddenly came to a standstill at the word of command
from their chief. One of the guides had remembered
that there was a better way to enter the city than risking
an encounter by going in full view of the Spaniards.
It was a difficult road, passing through a thick wood,
but Morgan decided to take it. So the army turned
off, and the Spaniards, seeing them do so, were filled
with dismay, for they had not dreamt the foe would take
that road, and had fixed all their batteries to oppose
them on the other.</p>

<p>It ended by the buccaneers coming on the town at
a side totally unprepared for attack, and the Spaniards
had hastily to leave their barricades and batteries. From
the summit of a hill the pirates looked down upon
Panama&mdash;and what seemed to them a whole host of
Spaniards. The governor had turned out all his forces,
consisting of two squadrons of cavalry, four regiments
of foot, and a fair amount of artillery. The sight of so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
many foes for a while struck fear into the hearts of the
ragged horde, who had known but little fear till then.
Some of them spoke of going back. But, taking counsel
amongst themselves, they decided that, after all, it was
desirable to do what they had come out for, and to
go into the fight with fierce courage, giving and taking
no quarter.</p>

<p>Morgan divided his army into three battalions, sending
in advance a company of 200 real buccaneers&mdash;that
is, the hunters of wild cattle.</p>

<p>And the fight began.</p>

<p>The Spaniards sent forward their cavalry at the
gallop, shouting &#8220;Viva el Rey&#8221;; but the rain had
soddened the ground, and the horses became unmanageable,
especially when the pirates&#8217; advance guard dropped
to their knees and sent in a withering fire of well-aimed
shots. But the Dons put up a bold defence, foot aiding
horse, artillery supporting both, till presently Morgan
man&#339;uvred so that the infantry were obliged to separate
from the cavalry. And then the buccaneers knew they
were on the way to victory.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, however, had a card up their sleeve.
When they debouched from the city, they brought with
them a herd of wild bulls, in charge of a band of Indians.
It was one part of the army with which they meant to
oppose the buccaneers. Finding that the battle was
going all against them, the Dons gave the word, and
the herd of bulls, maddened by the cries and lashes of
the Indians, went full pelt across the plain, straight for
Morgan&#8217;s gallant little army. It looked as though
there were going to be a bull-fight instead of a battle
between men. Instead of that, the noise of the conflict,
which still went on between buccaneers and Spaniards,
so scared the bulls that they turned and ran away. A
few, however, broke through the English battalion, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
did no more damage than to tear the colours. The result
was that the buccaneers found themselves with enough
meat to last them many days.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, disappointed at the failure of their
ruse, held on with the courage of despair, fighting for
two more hours, having the greater part of their cavalry
killed, the rest fleeing for their lives. The infantry and
artillery, however, kept up the fight till, with a rush,
the buccaneers swept down upon them; and then, firing
only the shots that were in their muskets, away the
Dons went, flinging their arms aside as they ran. The
buccaneers, battle-worn, were too weary to follow them,
and hundreds managed to reach the safety of the woods,
those few that remained on the field being killed out
of hand.</p>

<p>Six hundred Spaniards died that day, while Morgan
&#8220;found both killed and wounded of his own men a
considerable number.&#8221; However, he was victorious,
and making his men rest before going up to the city,
examined a few prisoners who were brought in. One
captain told him that the troops in Panama consisted of
400 horse, twenty-four companies of infantry of 100
men each, and 2,000 bulls, while in the city trenches
had been made and batteries dotted about to enfilade
the streets up which the buccaneers must go.</p>

<p>Morgan and his men, however, vowed to go on,
and after resting marched forward against the city,
which, when they approached, opened up a terrific fire
from the batteries, the guns being loaded with pieces of
iron and musket-balls. The cannonade wrought havoc
with Morgan&#8217;s men, who, however, pressed forward,
nothing daunted, and after a stern fight lasting three
hours, they entered the city, rushing up the streets,
which, guarded by the great guns, swept lanes through
their ranks. It was a case of fighting from barricade to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
barricade, taking battery after battery; fighting a way
up one street, and then down another. For three hours
the fierce fight went on, and still the buccaneers were
winning.</p>

<p>Then came the end. Gathering his forces, the
governor opposed the pirates gallantly, and a fierce
hand-to-hand conflict waged, out of which the buccaneers
came victorious, and the city fell. Morgan had
achieved what he had set out to do. Through the
streets the raiders rushed, killing every soul who opposed
them, giving no quarter; and when the work of
blood was done, Morgan called his men together.</p>

<p>He commended them on their gallant fight, and
then scared them into sobriety. He knew what kind
of men he had to deal with, and knew that, if they
once fell to the lure of wine, they would be at the
mercy of any small band of Spaniards who might
return. Morgan lied to his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the wine in the city has been poisoned!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Drink but one cup, and you will die!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sadly disappointed&mdash;for they loved nothing so much
as debauchery, except it were a fight&mdash;the buccaneers
promised to keep off the drink. Though some of them
in their hearts told themselves that he lied, they were too
scared to try to prove it. So Morgan became leader of
a <i>sober</i> army of buccaneers!</p>

<p>Then there began the looting of the city. The inhabitants
had taken the precaution of removing a great
deal of their valuables; but there was still sufficient left
to provide much spoil for the buccaneers, who ransacked
every building in Panama. When all had been taken,
Morgan commanded many of the largest houses to be
fired. The people who still remained in the city had
been tortured indescribably to make them reveal the
secret hiding-places of their wealth, and a veritable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
reign of terror lasted while the buccaneers remained
in Panama.</p>

<p>It was not until February 24, 1671, that Morgan and
the remains of his army evacuated the city; and when
they did so they had 175 beasts of burden laden with
gold, silver, and other precious things. They took
600 wretched prisoners with them to sell into slavery.</p>

<p>Truly, they had wrought well from their point of
view. Morgan made every man allow himself to be
searched to show that he had nothing concealed about
him when they arrived at Chagre. Then, having sent
to the island of St. Catherine to ask the prisoners he
had left there to ransom the castle, and receiving the
reply that the buccaneers could do just what they
pleased with it, Morgan got down to the distribution of
the spoils. In this matter there was some dispute; the
buccaneers accused Morgan of having stolen part of the
treasure. They were utterly discontented with the share
of 200 pieces of eight each, knowing full well that the
haul had been large enough to provide more. Morgan
listened to their complaints, kept a still tongue in his
head, kept, too, the treasure, and one night, going
aboard his ship secretly, slipped out to sea, followed
only by three or four vessels whose men were in the
plot, and made for Jamaica.</p>

<p>There the buccaneering days of Captain Morgan
ended. He changed his spots, became a law-abiding
citizen, received pardon for his misdeeds, and ended up
by receiving a knighthood! Before that great day,
however, he had been Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica.
Finally he was made Governor, with power to put down
piracy. And of all the governors of Jamaica Sir Henry
Morgan was the most severe on buccaneers and pirates!</p>

<p class="ph1">Thrilling Stories of Pirates</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIRATES!</p>

<p>The word conjures up visions of ferocious men
with pistol in hand, knife in mouth, clothes stained
with blood, planks run out of a ship&#8217;s side, and unfortunate,
blindfolded men being driven to their death;
treasure in galore; high jinks ashore till the call for
action came again.</p>

<p>A pretty picture&mdash;perhaps; and only too well
founded on fact.</p>

<p>When, in 1689, France and England joined hands
in the determination to sweep the buccaneer from the
seas, and to effect this closed all used harbours to him,
the ruffian adopted new methods. As we have seen,
the buccaneers were something of a community, recognised
up to a point by different nations, and the French
and English buccaneers waged private war against the
Spaniard. The assumption of so much power, as shown
by Morgan, made the nations anxious, and the result
was that when they decided to put an end to the
buccaneer, whether he only attacked Spaniards or not,
that worthy, finding himself a general outcast, declared
against everybody; he became a pirate to whom no ship
was immune.</p>

<p>Previously the scourges of the sea had been able to
use frequented harbours to dispose of their prisoners
and treasure; now they found themselves compelled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
find new ports, and these were generally desert islands.
Here they marooned their prisoners, or hid their treasure
against the time when they could come and dig it up.</p>

<p>To take Blackbeard first.</p>

<p>Blackbeard was his nickname, given him because
of the long whiskers that he wore, tied up with ribbons
on occasions, if you please! Altogether Captain
Edward Teach, to give him his right name, was a
somewhat picturesque ruffian, with a sling over his
shoulders to carry three brace of pistols, lighted matches
under his hat, his beribboned beard and his flamboyant
costume made up of things he had purloined during his
cruises. He began life as a seaman on a privateer,
rising to the command of a sloop in 1716. The sloop,
by the way, was a prize captured by his friend Captain
Hornygold, with whom in 1717 Teach sailed on a
voyage down the American mains. After a fairly prosperous
cruise the pirates parted company, Teach having
command of a new prize, a large French Guineaman,
and Hornygold going to Providence, where he surrendered
to the King&#8217;s mercy, probably having had
enough of the life adventurous and realising that a
recent proclamation gave him an opportunity to leave
his profession without sacrificing his life.</p>

<p>Blackbeard, however, was but just beginning, as it
were, and he turned his Guineaman into a formidable
fighting ship, mounting forty guns in her, and giving
her the new name of the <i>Queen Anne&#8217;s Revenge</i>. All
being ready, he sailed, and almost immediately fell in
with a large ship called the <i>Great Allen</i>, off the Isle
of St. Vincent. He soon overcame any resistance made,
took out of her all that he wanted, marooned the crew,
set fire to the ship, and sent her drifting out to sea,
a flaming testimony to the methods he was going to
adopt in his profession.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>A day or so afterwards he came up against a different
kind of ship; she was an English man-o&#8217;-war, the
<i>Scarborough</i>, thirty guns. There was a fine set-to
for some hours, for Teach was nothing loath to accept
a really good scrap when the opportunity arose, especially
when, as in this case, he was stronger than his
foe. The guns blared out their thunderous music, there
were some near shaves for boarding; but in the end
the <i>Scarborough</i> found that she had undertaken too
big a task, and sheered off. Mighty pleased, Teach
now got swelled head, and felt himself strong enough
for anything, and felt stronger still when, sailing for
the Spanish Main, he joined forces with another pirate,
Major Bonnet, who, finding a planter&#8217;s life too
monotonous, had taken to the sea as a gentleman
adventurer. Teach soon found out that Bonnet was
no sailorman, and likely to be more bother than he
was worth in command of a ship; so he put one of his
comrades named Richards in command of the sloop
and took Bonnet on his own ship. It was no good
Bonnet protesting; Teach spoke, and it <i>was</i>! He was
an autocrat, this merry pirate!</p>

<p>The two vessels now put in at Turneffe, near the
Gulf of Honduras, to take in water, and while doing
this an unfortunate sloop, the <i>Adventure</i>, came along;
whereupon Richards slipped out after her. All unsuspecting,
the <i>Adventure</i> held on. Then came consternation&mdash;the
pirate had hoisted the Jolly Roger!</p>

<p>And the <i>Adventure</i> struck and surrendered, which
gave Teach another ship for his little Armada. Then
away to Honduras, where they discovered a large ship,
the <i>Protestant C&aelig;sar</i> (Captain Wyar) and four sloops.
Sailing boldly in, the pirates hoisted the black flag,
banged away at the ships, and called upon them to
surrender. Immediately Wyar and his crew took to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
a boat and raced ashore, leaving the <i>Protestant C&aelig;sar</i>
at the mercy of the pirates, who took possession, and
after rifling her, burnt her, as they did one of the sloops.
The other three they let go.</p>

<p>Leaving Honduras, the pirates sailed about the
neighbouring seas, taking prizes at their will and
reaping a rich harvest. Finally, they came to anchor
off the bar at Charlestown, Carolina, where they continued
their depredations, capturing many ships, one
of them a brigantine full of negro slaves. Blackbeard&#8217;s
sojourn off Charlestown was nothing more or less than
a blockade, and a very effective one; no ship dared
try to enter or leave the port, and the whole trade of
the town was at a standstill, while day by day Teach
was adding to the number of his prizes.</p>

<p>Finding that he stood in need of a medicine-chest,
Teach decided that the best way to get it was to apply
to the Governor of Charlestown. Confident that he held
the trump cards in the game, the pirate sent Richards
and two or three other men into Charlestown, sending
with them one named Marks, whom they had taken
prisoner on one of the ships.</p>

<p>The pirates landed, swaggered into the town,
bearded the authorities brazenly, and in none too
courteous manner told them that they wanted medicines,
and that the council of Carolina must provide them.
If they were not forthcoming, and if the envoys were
not allowed to return unmolested, then Teach threatened
that he would burn every one of the large number
of ships he had captured, would kill every man found
on them, and send their heads to the governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Marks interviewed the council, and Richards
and his companions sauntered about the town flaunting
the people, who dared not lay a finger upon them! The
council, in a quandary, argued about the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
amongst themselves; but as the lives of so many people
were at stake (by the way, one of their own number,
Mr. Samuel Wragg, was a prisoner to Teach), they
soon came to the conclusion that, however disgraceful
it might be, there was nothing to be done but meet
the pirates&#8217; demands. So when the sloop went back it
carried a medicine-chest worth nearly four hundred
pounds!</p>

<p>Teach, true to his word, set the prisoners free, rifled
the ships of a small fortune, and then sailed away to
North Carolina. Here Blackbeard put into execution
a little plot. He had succeeded in gathering a fine
harvest of riches, and felt that it was a shame to have
to share it with so many folk. He therefore decided
to get rid of some of them. Running his own vessel
ashore, while Israel Hands (in the plot with him) ran
one of the sloops ashore as well, the precious pair rowed
out to the third sloop with forty men, took possession
of her, and marooned seventeen of her crew on a small
deserted island well away from the coast. Fortunately
for them, Major Bonnet, at this time in command of
another sloop, came up two days later and took them
off; otherwise they would have perished.</p>

<p>Having got rid of some of the crew, Teach now
landed and, accompanied by twenty of his men, called
on the governor of North Carolina, not with the intention
of plundering him, but for the purpose of
surrendering under the clement proclamation. Governor
Charles Eden gave him his pardon, and the pirate, now
fairly wealthy, soon became friends with him; so much
so that when Blackbeard cast covetous eyes upon one
of the ships he had captured some time before, the
governor called the Court of the Vice-Admiralty, which
condemned the vessel as a prize taken from the
Spaniards by Captain Teach. This was straining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
things rather, seeing that Teach had never held a
commission in the King&#8217;s navy! No doubt Governor
Eden made something out of the deal.</p>

<p>Teach&#8217;s idea in getting the ship was that he felt
the time ripe for resuming the old life; and he felt
that, with a friend at court, he would have a much
easier time of it. So in June, 1718, after having
married a young girl of sixteen (his fourteenth wife,
a dozen still being alive!), Blackbeard put to sea,
shaping his course for the Bermudas. He had a
rollicking time for several months, taking rich prizes,
terrorising the captains who traded thereabouts, and
going back to North Carolina occasionally to square
things up with the governor, who was now so far in
the ditch that Teach felt strong enough to be saucy
to him&mdash;just to teach him his place!</p>

<p>No matter what protests were entered at North
Carolina, no matter how many angry captains appealed
to the governor for redress and protection, nothing
was done; and Teach held sway. Things assumed
such a pass that a deputation of captains was sent to
the Governor of Virginia, to request that steps should
be taken against Teach. In the James River were
two men-o&#8217;-war, the <i>Lima</i> and the <i>Pearl</i>, and two
sloops were manned by sailors from the warships
under command of Lieutenant Maynard, of the <i>Pearl</i>.
Then, after a proclamation offering rewards for the
apprehension, dead or alive, of the pirates, the sloops
set out for where the pirates were at anchor in the
Okercok inlet, in the James River. Maynard had
taken the precaution to stop all vessels from going
up the river, lest news of his coming should be
given the pirates. Governor Eden, aware of the
expedition, sent four pirates from Bath Town to warn
Teach what was afoot. The pirate, however, had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
several other warnings, which he refused to believe,
and he took the news the governor sent him with a
grain of salt. The result was that Maynard was able
to get within sight of the pirate vessels without
hindrance. And then Teach believed!</p>

<p>Roaring out orders to the twenty-five men on board,
he quickly cleared for action, determined to show fight.
Then, when all was ready, he calmly sat down to
supper and a carousal, knowing that the shoals were
too dangerous for Maynard to attempt cutting him out
till daylight came.</p>

<p>Hardly waiting for the sun to rise, Maynard next
morning sent a boat ahead to take soundings in the
intricate channel, and drew near to the pirate ship.
Within gunshot, he was subjected to a heavy fire by
Teach, who, when the sloops hoisted the King&#8217;s colours
and raced at him with sail and oar, cut cable and tried
to make a running fight of it. He brought all his big
guns to bear upon the sloops, but these pushed on
through the hail of shot, and, having no guns mounted,
kept up a rain of small-arm fire. They hung on like
leeches, dodged the pirate, and made him dodge to such
an extent that Teach was at his wit&#8217;s end what to do,
and at last ran ashore. Maynard&#8217;s sloop was of deeper
draught than the pirate, and could not get near until
the ballast was flung overboard and the water-casks
staved in. Then, lightened considerably, she was
able to get close enough to Teach to make him
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; yelled Blackbeard. &#8220;Where are
you from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re no pirates,&#8221; retorted Maynard, &#8220;as you can
see by our colours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send a boat, then, so that I can see who you are,&#8221;
said Teach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; answered Maynard, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t spare
a boat. I&#8217;ll come aboard with the sloop, however, as
soon as I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seize my soul,&#8221; cried Teach, quaffing wine, &#8220;if I
give you quarter, or take any from you!&#8221;</p>

<p>A sentiment with which Maynard told him he
heartily agreed.</p>

<p>The pirate ship was now afloat again, and the battle
started once more. As the sloops were no more than
a foot high in the waist the crews were exposed to fire
as they tugged at the oars; and Teach took advantage
of this. He discharged a whole broadside of small shot,
which killed twenty men on Maynard&#8217;s ship and nine
on the other, which was disabled, and fell astern as
the pirate vessel went broadside to the shore in order
to present but one flank to attack. Maynard, fearing
another broadside, ordered his men below, and he and
the helmsman alone remained on deck as the sloop
ran alongside the pirate.</p>

<p>Down below Maynard&#8217;s men were ready for the
word of command that should send them scrambling
up the pirate&#8217;s side. Up on Teach&#8217;s deck men
lined the side with hand grenades made of case-bottles
filled with powder, slugs, small shot, and fired with
a quick-match; and as the sloop came alongside these
were hurled down into her.</p>

<p>Teach, looking over, saw only Maynard and the
helmsman alive, with many dead men lying about the
deck, and, thinking that he had effectively put them
out of the fight, cried to his men:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all knocked on the head except three or
four. Let&#8217;s jump in and cut the rest to pieces!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down into the sloop, therefore, went Teach and
fourteen of his cut-throats, expecting an easy triumph.
The smoke from the grenades obscured things so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Maynard could not see what had happened; but as it
cleared away, and he realised that he had been boarded,
he called upon his men, who swarmed up on deck
and fell like an avalanche upon the pirates.</p>

<p>Maynard tackled Blackbeard himself. The two fired
simultaneously, and Teach was wounded slightly, but
not badly enough to prevent him from engaging in some
sword play with Maynard. In the midst of that fighting
crowd the two men fought hard and long, neither
gaining much advantage, until at last Maynard&#8217;s sword
snapped in two, and he seemed at the mercy of the
pirate. He stepped back quickly, cocked his pistol;
but ere he could fire Blackbeard had swung down upon
him with his cutlass. For a moment it seemed that
Maynard was done, but, with a yell, one of his men
hurled himself at Teach, slashed at him with a cutlass
that gashed his throat and neck and put him off his
stroke, so that Maynard received only a slight wound
on his finger.</p>

<p>Still the fight went on, thirteen men against fifteen,
the odds in favour of the pirates. The deck was slippery
with blood; men whom the firing had laid low were
trampled upon as the yelling, cursing, hacking crowd
swayed this way and that. Now the fight seemed to be
going in favour of the pirates, now of the royal crew;
and Teach cheered on his men savagely, cursing them,
exhorting them.</p>

<p>Blackbeard, although wounded in several places,
was a game scoundrel, and kept on with the fight; he
was literally covered with pistols, which he kept drawing
and firing; and when the fight ended he was
smothered with wounds&mdash;twenty-five of them! And
one wound was mortal, for he dropped dead to the
deck, to keep eight of his fourteen company in death.
The other six flung themselves overboard, but were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
captured. Then, the second royal sloop coming up,
the remainder of the pirates on the big sloop were
attacked, and after a stiff fight they surrendered.</p>

<p>When the vessel was captured, it was found that
Teach had arranged for it to be blown up, with its
living freight, as soon as Maynard boarded her; and
the negro who had had the task allotted to him was
with difficulty dissuaded from carrying it out when he
found out that Teach had been killed.</p>

<p>Blackbeard&#8217;s head was cut off and hung at the
bowsprit end of the royal sloop, which sailed with it
to Bath Town, where Maynard, having found papers
incriminating Governor Eden, forced that gentleman
to return the spoils that Teach had given him; and in
due course sailed back to the men-o&#8217;-war with fifteen
prisoners, who were brought to justice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Howell Davis</span>, who adopted much the same
tactics as the old buccaneers, mutinied against his
captain and assumed command of the ship, which he
turned into a pirate craft. After several little affairs,
in which he gained much treasure and many reinforcements
of men, till he had seventy under him, he aimed
at something higher than merely holding up ships on
the seas. He thought he would like to capture Gambia
Castle, on the coast of Guinea, a place where there was
always a good store of money. Sailing in, he sent all
his men below, except a few who were needed to work
the ship, and, coming to anchor under the fort, hoisted
out a boat, manned it with six men dressed like any
ordinary sailormen, and sent the doctor and the master
with them as merchants.</p>

<p>The governor, named Foyle, had seen the ship come
in, and sent a company of soldiers down to the shore
to welcome the new-comers, who were taken into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
castle, where the governor greeted them kindly. The
pirates lied glibly, telling the governor that they were
from Liverpool, bound for Senegal, but, having been
chased by a couple of French men-o&#8217;-war, had put in
at Gambia for safety. Would the governor trade with
them for slaves? Gathering that the merchants had
a large cargo of plate and iron, the governor agreed
to barter, asking incidentally whether they had any
liquor aboard. Davis said they had, and promised
him a hamper for his own use, if he would care to
accept it.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed at the generosity, the governor invited
Davis and his comrades to dinner with him; Davis
accepted, but said that he must go on board first to
see that everything was all right. He would return in
time for dinner, bringing the liquor with him.</p>

<p>Davis had been taking notes of everything in the
fort, and when he got back to his ship was able to
assure his rascally crew that before night the fort would
be in their possession&mdash;if they didn&#8217;t get drunk. They
promised to be good, and to send twenty men on shore
directly they saw the flag of the fort struck&mdash;the signal
that Davis had captured it. Davis took the precaution,
in the evening, of securing the crew of a little sloop
that lay in the harbour, lest they should hear anything
and give warning to the governor.</p>

<p>Then, taking the hamper of liquor, Davis entered
his boat, which had a number of men in it, each armed
with two pairs of pistols, carefully hidden, and with
instructions to mingle with the soldiers in the guard-room
while Davis was engaged with the governor.
When Davis fired a pistol through the governor&#8217;s
window they were to set about the soldiers at once, and
seize all the arms in the guard-room.</p>

<p>In due course the pirate was with the governor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
waiting dinner, and making a bowl of punch to while
the time away. Never was man more surprised than
that luckless governor when, in the midst of the convivialities,
Davis poked a pistol in his face, and told
him that unless he surrendered the castle and all the
money it contained, he would shoot him like a dog!</p>

<p>What could a man do? the governor evidently
asked himself. Foyle gave in. Davis and the coxswain,
the master and the doctor, having closed the
door, took possession of all the weapons in the
governor&#8217;s room, and loaded all the pistols. Then
Davis fired through the window, as arranged. Instantly
his men in the guard-room got to work; they placed
themselves between the soldiers and their piled-up arms,
and, with cocked pistols at the heads of the soldiers,
called upon them to surrender. They did so; it was
no use trying to resist ruffians who were so well armed!
The soldiers were locked in the room, the flag was
struck, reinforcements came from the ship, and during
the day the pirates enjoyed themselves to the full,
plundering everything, and reaping a fairly rich
harvest. Davis, who felt he wanted more men, prevailed
upon certain of the soldiers to join him; the
others he placed on board the sloop, having taken the
precaution of removing all sails, etc., from her, so
that they could not escape.</p>

<p>Then, having got all that was to be obtained, Davis
ordered the fortification to be destroyed and the guns dismounted,
and, considering it time to be gone, weighed
anchor. Just as the ship was setting sail the pirates
saw a vessel bearing down upon them. Not knowing
what kind of a ship she might be, whether friend
or foe&mdash;they had very few friends, and far too many
foes!&mdash;Davis had all his men to arms to receive the
new-comer, who, when near enough, let fly a shot across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
the pirate&#8217;s bows and hoisted the black flag! Davis,
overjoyed at the turn of events, returned the compliment
both with shot and flag, and in a few minutes the two
captains were hobnobbing together. Davis found that
the new-comer was a pirate under the command of a
Frenchman named La Bouse; and, joining forces, the
precious pair sailed down the coast to Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>Here they saw a tall ship riding at anchor, and
decided that she would make a good prize. The thing
that worried them was that she did not attempt to
escape, which made them wonder whether she might
not be a heavily armed vessel, who felt sure of herself
and didn&#8217;t mind a fight. However, Davis sailed in
boldly, and his ship literally staggered back as she
received a full and heavy broadside; and up went the
stranger&#8217;s flag&mdash;a black one! Truly Davis was meeting
some queer adventures! It did not take long to
explain matters, and Davis and La Bouse found themselves
in company with another band of pirates, under
a rogue named Cocklyn. They fraternised together for
three days, the first two being spent in true pirate
fashion&mdash;feasting and debauching; on the third a
council of war was held, at which it was agreed to join
forces, Davis being appointed to supreme command.
However, the friends soon quarrelled amongst themselves,
and the three captains nearly came to blows one
day while they were engaged in a debauch.</p>

<p>Davis decided that the affair must end at once, before
worse happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark ye, Cocklyn and La Bouse!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I
find that, by strengthening you, I have put a rod into
your hands to whip myself. However, I am still able
to deal with you both; but since we met in love,
let us part in love, for it&#8217;s very plain that three of a
trade can never agree.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>The other pirates saw the wisdom of Davis&#8217;s
opinion, and the result was that they parted company.
We will leave the others, and follow Davis to his tragic
end. Ambitious as ever, he captured a big Dutch ship
with thirty guns in her, and, mounting twenty-seven
more, sailed to the Isle of Princes, which he thought to
raid. To the governor he passed himself off as the
captain of an English man-o&#8217;-war searching for pirates.
The governor welcomed him and feasted him, and, to
return the compliment, Davis, presenting him with a
dozen slaves, invited him on board to a feast, asking
him to bring some of the chief men and friars from the
island. The governor agreed, and Davis was highly
pleased, for he had fashioned a little plot whereby, as
soon as the governor boarded the ship, he and his
friends were to be taken prisoner, and held to ransom
for &pound;40,000.</p>

<p>Poor Pirate Davis! He was doomed to disappointment
on this occasion. A negro, watching his opportunity,
that night slipped overboard, swam to the shore,
burst like a tornado upon the governor, and warned
him of the plot.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Davis went ashore, the
governor met him with smiling face, invited him to
join him at the house in a little refreshment, and, chatting
affably, the party walked up. Presently the
governor shifted somewhat, and at a given signal a
withering volley was poured in at the pirates, who, with
one exception, fell to the ground. The plot had failed!</p>

<p>Davis, wounded in the bowels though he was, rose
to his feet and endeavoured to get away; he dropped
in his tracks, and in the moment of death pulled out
his pistols, and fired them point-blank at his pursuers.</p>

<p>When those on board the ship saw what had happened,
they hurried away post-haste, and, once clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
of the island, elected a new captain. The choice fell
upon Bartholomew Roberts, and a really fine pirate
chief he made. He was a born fighter and leader of
men; he stood no nonsense from anyone, and the man
who disputed his authority knew it to his cost. He
cared for nobody, and, although we need not follow
his whole career, he did so much damage amongst
shipping, both off Africa and America, that his name
became a byword amongst mariners. He was a terror
of the seas.</p>

<p>He cut a picturesque figure when he went fighting.
He would overhaul a ship, pound at her for all he was
worth, and then, entering his longboat, row over and
tackle her. All his men were extravagant in their tastes
regarding dress, but Roberts was worse than all; he
dressed in a rich crimson damask waistcoat and breeches,
wore a large black hat with a crimson feather, a gold
chain round his neck, with a diamond pendant, a silk band
hanging from his shoulders to carry his pistols. Thus,
sword in hand, he led his men to the fight, dashing,
very often, through a very hail of shot, and, with shouts
and curses, urging his men on as they tried to board.
A stiff fight very often ensued, and then the pirates,
having run the gauntlet of fire, scrambled up the side
of the ship and, after a fierce hand-to-hand fight, had
her beaten.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Sword in hand, Roberts led his men to the fight, dashing through a very hail of shot&#8221;</p>

<p>But, though he played this game many a time with
much success, Nemesis was at hand. The <i>Royal
Fortune</i>, as he called his last ship, had as consort the
<i>Ranger</i>, and the two ships caused such depredation that
the British cruiser <i>Swallow</i> scoured the seas to find
them, eventually running them to earth in the River
Gaboon. The <i>Royal Fortune</i> lay well up the river, but
the <i>Ranger</i> was at the mouth, and, seeing the <i>Swallow</i>
approach with portholes closed, her crew hugged themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
with delight in anticipation of another prize.
They thought she was a sugar ship, and they badly
wanted sugar. They therefore hoisted sail and gave
chase, which was just what the <i>Swallow</i> wanted. Lieutenant
Sun, in command, had realised that the <i>Ranger</i>
had made a mistake, and he led her on till she was
well away from the river and out of gunshot of the
<i>Royal Fortune</i>, which he meant to tackle later on.</p>

<p>The pirates, lured on by the thought of the sugar
cargo sped after the <i>Swallow</i>, drew near enough to fire
their bow chasers, and then opened on the quarry. Up
went the black flag at the same time&mdash;as though the
<i>Swallow</i> wanted to be told who they were!&mdash;and then,
after a little further chase, drew alongside and prepared
to board. The ruffianly looking crew lined the side of
the <i>Ranger</i>. That moment the lower ports of the
<i>Swallow</i> opened, and a terrific broadside crashed into
the side of the astonished pirate. They had been bitten,
deceived. They cursed their foes and drew off, though
not before the black flag came fluttering down to the
deck. Then, having hoisted another Jolly Roger, they
tried to get away; but the <i>Swallow</i> was swifter than
their own ship, and her guns better handled, with the
result that, after a running fight of two hours, the black
flag came down again, this time struck by the pirates;
and the <i>Ranger</i> was captured.</p>

<p>They were a cheerful lot of pirates which the <i>Swallow</i>
took aboard; they did not seem to mind the prospect of
the gallows, but joked and laughed, and treated the
whole affair as a huge joke. They even tried to blow
the <i>Ranger</i> up before they were taken off, with the
pirates and the Navy men on board. Lieutenant Sun
sent the <i>Ranger</i> into port with a prize crew, and then
made off for the Gaboon River again, to tackle Roberts,
in the <i>Royal Fortune</i>. While the fight had been going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
on, Roberts had been busy; he had captured a ship,
and was sailing away with her when the <i>Swallow</i>
sighted him on February 9, 1722. Sun kept as far
away as possible, so that Roberts should not suspect
he was being followed, and allowed him to anchor in
a bay near Cape Lopez for the night. Roberts, who,
if he had known, might have given the <i>Swallow</i> the
slip, remained there, all unconscious of the fate coming
to him. He was at breakfast next morning when news
was brought him of a tall ship being near at hand.
Roberts said it must be the <i>Ranger</i> returning, or a
slave ship; anyway, it was nothing to get into a turmoil
about. He soon found his mistake, for the stranger
hoisted her colour, opened her ports, and showed
Roberts that he was in for a scrap.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a bite!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Get ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>While his men rushed to arms, Roberts stood on his
deck in all the glory of his pilfered attire. There came
to him one of his men who, a deserter from the Navy,
had once sailed aboard the <i>Swallow</i>, and knew her
powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;She sails best before the wind,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and we
can escape, if we want to, by running for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roberts thought a while. He knew that he was
in a tight corner, for the <i>Swallow&#8217;s</i> men were brilliant
fighters, and she was a sturdy ship. He decided, after
all, he would run for it, making up his mind that, if
everything else failed, he would either run the ship
ashore, and let his men shift for themselves, or else
dash down upon the <i>Swallow</i>, board her, and blow up
both ships!</p>

<p>So the orders were given, and the <i>Royal Fortune</i>
swooped down upon the <i>Swallow</i>, intending to give her
a broadside as she passed. The <i>Swallow</i> opened fire
as the black flag fluttered aloft; Roberts returned it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
and then swung away. But, just as he thought he was
safe, the <i>Royal Fortune</i> failed them. Something went
wrong; she did not answer to the helm, and failed to
catch the wind. The <i>Swallow</i> drew near!</p>

<p>What Roberts would have done it is impossible to
say; what he did, however, was to die at that moment.
A grapeshot hurtled across the deck, struck him in the
throat, and killed him outright. He dropped to the deck
in a sitting posture. The helmsman, thinking he was
fooling, cursed him roundly, and tried to get him on
his feet, but, finding the pirate chief dead, began to
cry, and prayed that the next shot might kill him off
too. The remainder of the ruffians seized the captain
and pitched him overboard, as he had instructed them
to do in case of death.</p>

<p>Then, leaderless, they scarcely knew what to do;
they were half drunk most of them, and though they
put up a little resistance, and some of them sought to
blow up the magazine, they at last struck their flag;
and the <i>Swallow</i> had cleared Roberts and his herd off
the sea.</p>

<p>So much for some of the pirates of long ago.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BLOCKADE RUNNING</h2>


<p class="ph1">Tales of Adventure in Eluding Watchful Blockaders</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Great War of 1914-15 showed what the command
of the sea really meant. It showed that
even although the greatest navy in the world had little
opportunity in the early stages to meet its foes in a
decisive battle&mdash;through the latter lurking in their
harbours&mdash;yet there was much work to be done: the
guarding of the ocean routes, the exertion of silent pressure
upon the enemy, who found his shipping held
up in harbour, and was unable to import food by the
coast even before a blockade had been declared. On
the other hand, in another chapter we have shown
how German raiding cruisers also played havoc with
the Allies&#8217; shipping, and pounced upon outlying places&mdash;only
at last to be brought to book. Here we are
concerned only with ships that have run blockades,
slipping through the cordon drawn around coasts,
running the risk of being sunk or captured.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_094.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;There was a whoosh! whoosh! of a rocket heavenwards&mdash;the warning to
the blockading fleet&#8221;</p>

<p>To go back to an earlier date, and a war which was
as nothing compared with the world war, we find that
during the American Civil War the Federals imposed
a strict blockade of the southern ports whence the much-needed
cotton was shipped. As a result cotton soared
in price, and men found a means to make fortunes by
slipping into blockaded ports with cargoes of stuff
wanted by the Confederates and taking cargoes of
cotton in their place, and then running the gauntlet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the watchful ships. Blockade running attracted hardy
adventurers of all nationalities&mdash;men to whom adventure
was the spice of life, and who, incidentally, found the
spice pretty hot!</p>

<p>One of the most daring of these runners was Captain
Hobart, an Englishman who joined the Royal Navy in
1836, worked hard and well in the suppression of the
slave trade in South America, served later in the
Crimean War, retiring in 1860. When the Civil War
broke out he took service as a blockade-runner, and
many were the daring trips he made. Wilmington was
his favourite port, although at the mouth of the river
the Federal fleet were in strong force, bombarding Fort
Fisher and keeping up the blockade, holding up ships
that were not fortunate enough to slip by in the night,
and chasing those which did not stop on command.</p>

<p>Hobart didn&#8217;t stop, although on one occasion he
was chased for many miles by a Federal cruiser. In his
cotton-laden ship he had slipped out of the river and
passed Fort Fisher at eleven o&#8217;clock one night, knowing
full well that lying off the mouth of the river were
twenty-five ships waiting to catch such as he.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark, and the blockade-runner, with
no lights showing, went at full steam ahead through
the channel over the bar, guided only by the faint lights
the Confederates had cunningly placed to enable ships
to enter the river safely. Hobart navigated his vessel
by these, and crossed the bar; and then saw that a large
barge had been placed by the Federals at the entrance
for the purpose of signalling if any ship tried to slip
out. The cotton ship almost ran the barge down, but
by quick man&#339;uvring avoided doing so, and steamed
on. Next instant there was the <i>whoosh! whoosh!</i> and
a rocket sped heavenwards&mdash;the warning to the blockading
fleet. Then there was the boom of a gun; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Hobart pushed forward, turned eastward, steaming a
mile or so from the coast. Now and then there came
the sound of guns being fired, sometimes quite close
at hand; but they saw no ship, neither were they seen
by any apparently, for nothing untoward happened
until about nine o&#8217;clock the next morning, when
through the rising mist they saw a large cruiser bearing
down upon them.</p>

<p>It was a case of running for it, and the cotton ship
sped on with her engines pounding out every ounce of
power there was in them. After her came the cruiser,
gaining at every yard, for the cargo of the runner was
very heavy, and she was unable to show a clean pair
of heels to the pursuer.</p>

<p>Some of the bales of cotton were shifted aft in order
to sink the screws as deep as possible, and so increase
the speed; but even this did not help them much, and
the cruiser was still gaining. Then Hobart had a
stroke of luck. About a mile in front of him he saw
peculiar ripples which he knew betokened the proximity
of the Gulf Stream. If he could only get his ship into
the stream quickly he might stand a chance of escape,
for the Gulf Stream, going at the rate of three miles
an hour, would help them on their way considerably.
The course was altered at once, and the cotton ship
sped on towards the stream, into which she entered;
and immediately her speed was accelerated. Meanwhile,
the cruiser had also changed course, but had not got
into the bosom of the stream, with the result that after
a time Hobart found he had gained some seven miles
on her.</p>

<p>Then about twelve o&#8217;clock the cruiser entered the
stream, and again the distance between the two ships
lessened, till by five o&#8217;clock only about three miles
separated them; and shortly after the cruiser opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
fire without result. Seven o&#8217;clock, and she was still
nearer, for her shots went over the cotton ship, and
Hobart began to think it was a case of giving up.
Then night fell, and the sky was overcast; fortunately
the cotton ship was in shadow cast by the moon shining
over edge of clouds. This made a huge difference to
their chance of escape, for when it came out from behind
the clouds it showed the chasing cruiser quite plainly,
but did not reveal her quarry, although she was barely a
mile away. Luck was certainly on Hobart&#8217;s side!</p>

<p>Changing his course, in order to confuse his pursuer,
who was still firing guns in rapid succession, although
she could not see her aim, Hobart presently gave the
order to &#8220;Stop!&#8221; and the cotton ship came to rest,
steam was blown off under water, and the still and silent
ship remained there till presently the men on board
saw the cruiser go racing past them, firing madly at
nothing!</p>

<p>Hobart got that cargo of cotton through all right!</p>

<p>Another Confederate blockade-runner was Captain
William Watson, of the <i>Rob Roy</i> schooner. He was
also a dispatch-carrier on the occasion we are about to
narrate, Major-General Magruder having entrusted him
with important documents which he was to deliver to
the Confederate States consul at Havana.</p>

<p>The night decided on to make the run was dark,
and there was a good strong wind, but an uncertain
one; outside the mouth of the Brazos River lurked a
number of Federal cruisers and gunboats. Watson
had for company two other schooners, the <i>Hind</i> and
the <i>Mary Elizabeth</i>. The <i>Rob Roy</i> took the pilot
aboard and led the way down the river and over the
bar; the <i>Rob Roy</i> and the <i>Mary Elizabeth</i> managed to
get away without being seen, but the <i>Hind</i> dropped
astern and was captured. Once clear of the mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
of the river the other two schooners sped under all the
sail they dare hoist, having to be sparing with it lest
the white show against the cliffs and reveal their presence.
They had something like ten or eleven hours of
darkness before them, and hoped to be well away from
the watchful cruisers by that time. A gale sprang up,
for which they were thankful, as it carried the ships
along at a rattling pace. The <i>Mary Elizabeth</i>, however,
was separated from the <i>Rob Roy</i>, which romped
through the seas at a speed that delighted Watson, for
by noon next day they had come a hundred and thirty
miles without anything unforeseen happening. The
only unfortunate thing was that the ship was now in
the track of Federal cruisers searching for blockade-runners
between New Orleans and Point Isabel; and
while Watson was thinking seriously of this the wind
dropped and the schooner was becalmed. The sails
were lowered, so that the ship should not be so noticeable
to any passing vessel, and Watson paced his deck
eating his head off with impatience, expecting every
minute to see a cruiser on the horizon. At two o&#8217;clock
he saw a ship which he knew spelt danger. Instantly
he made up his mind what to do. In the Brazos River
they had picked up a couple of sweeps, and these were
brought into use, together with boat oars. Then all
the men available bent their backs to the task of rowing
the schooner! They steered her so that she would go
out of the course of the new-comer, and after working
like niggers for goodness knows how long they managed
to get her three miles, and then saw the other
vessel pass them seven miles away. Watson thanked
his lucky stars that he had taken in his sails, for
the bare poles he knew would be scarcely visible to
a steamer at such a distance away.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Towards evening a light breeze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
came up, sails were set once more, and the schooner
went on her way until early next morning, when the
wind dropped again, and the sails were lowered as
before. She was becalmed for that day and the following
night; and in the morning there appeared a large
ship which some of the men aboard were sure was a
man-o&#8217;-war. So it was out sweeps again to get the
schooner out of danger. When they were some nine
miles away from the man-o&#8217;-war the wind came up,
which&mdash;strange how men get what they want when they
would rather be without it!&mdash;they regarded as unfortunate,
for they dared not hoist sail lest they be
discovered.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, it was decided to take the risk,
and every inch of canvas was crowded on, and away
sped the <i>Rob Roy</i>, Watson hoping to get clear before
the man-o&#8217;-war had a chance to hoist her sails. They
had gone some distance when they noticed that the
wind had caught the warship, and that she had hoisted
all her canvas and was pelting along after them as
fast as she could sail. Watson suddenly tacked, and the
large vessel, keeping on her port tack, passed by to
leeward some six miles away. Then, when she tacked
about to follow them, Watson went back to his old
course, and once more gained on her, for every time
the warship changed course she had to lose way.</p>

<p>So the queer chase went on; but the warship gained
upon the <i>Rob Roy</i>, and Watson&#8217;s one hope was that
he would be able to keep at a safe distance, out of range
of her guns, until night fell, when he would stand a
better chance of giving her the slip. The sailors on the
man-o&#8217;-war, anticipating that the wind would soon drop,
worked hard to get their vessel as near to the runaway
as possible, so that if that should happen they might
be able to tackle her in their boats. Watson knew this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and still kept tacking about to increase the distance,
until at last the wind did fall and the two ships were
becalmed.</p>

<p>The man-o&#8217;-war was some four miles off then, and
Watson had his sweeps and oars out again, the men
falling to with a will; but as there was a slight sea
against them they were not able to propel the ship so
far as they had done previously. Soon Watson saw
a couple of boats put off from the warship, their men
pulling with all their might, hoping to catch the
schooner before the breeze came up again. When they
were a mile away the wind came, and the <i>Rob Roy</i>,
aided by the sweeps, began to make some way, but
not sufficient to outpace the boats, one of which came
to within a quarter of a mile. The men on board now
began to think that all was up, that they might just as
well surrender; and Watson got his dispatches ready
to throw overboard. He had wrapped them in canvas,
weighted with a piece of chain, so that they should sink
and not fall into the enemy&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>Just when it seemed that they must be overhauled
the wind became stronger, and the men, working hard
at their sweeps, the sails bulging out as they caught the
breeze, carried the schooner along at a pace that soon
left the boats far behind; and the men stood up and
waved their hands tauntingly to the sailors who had
thought to have them in a few minutes.</p>

<p>A rifle-shot rang out across the waters, then others,
and the bullets whistled across the deck, narrowly missing
the men. The warship now made after her boats,
to pick them up, and this gave the <i>Rob Roy</i> a better
chance of escape. Then the wind freshened so much
that Watson became nervous; too much wind was not
good for the overladen <i>Rob Roy</i>, and the sea was
getting very boisterous. To make matters worse, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
schooner was leaking very badly, and some of the men
had to be told off to work the pumps for all they were
worth.</p>

<p>As night fell the warship had gained considerably,
and opened fire with her guns, the shots, however, falling
short. Then the <i>Rob Roy</i> was hidden by the darkness.
Watson at once changed his tack in order to
baffle the pursuer, and all through the night the
schooner scudded before the wind, and by morning had
left the cruiser far behind, reaching Tampico in due
course without further adventure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURES ON A DESERT ISLAND</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Story of Some Castaways&mdash;and a Scoundrel</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN October, 1628, there sailed from the Texel a Dutch
ship, the <i>Batavia</i>, under the command of Captain
Francis Pelsart. Now Pelsart wasn&#8217;t the best of navigators,
and after having been at sea for nine months he
lost his way on a trackless ocean, and, though he did
not know it, he was close to the islands known as
Houtman&#8217;s Abrohos, or Houtman&#8217;s Rocks, off the
west coast of Australia&mdash;the seas in that quarter of the
globe not being, as every schoolboy knows, the best
known in those far-off days. As a matter of fact,
Captain Pelsart was having a run of hard luck&mdash;lost,
sick, and with a coming wreck in front of him, and not
far off, either. While Pelsart lay in his cabin, without
warning of any kind except the booming of the
breakers, the <i>Batavia</i> went pounding on a shoal off
Houtman&#8217;s Rocks, where she stuck fast.</p>

<p>Jumping out of his cabin, Pelsart rushed on deck,
and, seeing the position of things, soundly rated the
master for his neglect; whereupon that worthy pointed
out, quite convincingly, that he wasn&#8217;t to blame, seeing
that as the place where they were had not been visited
by anyone else before&mdash;so far as he knew&mdash;how was he
to know the reefs and shoals? This argument, of
course, commended itself to Pelsart, who, realising that
the best must be made of a bad job, bethought himself
of getting the <i>Batavia</i> off the shoal. He had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
cannon with which the ship was armed pitched overboard,
in the hope that this would lighten her sufficiently
to float her. But the <i>Batavia</i> refused to be
floated, and when a sudden and heavy squall came down
on her Pelsart really thought everything was over; but
the <i>Batavia</i> weathered it all right, and, taking a last
desperate chance, the captain ordered the mainmast to
be cut away. This was done, but in such a way that,
instead of going clear over, it fell on the deck.</p>

<p>Convinced finally that there was no chance of
getting his ship off, Pelsart wondered what was to be
done for the safety of his passengers and crew. Just
a little distance away, in the bright moonlight, he could
see two small islands, while some three leagues off lay
a larger island. He resolved to have the islands inspected
to see what they were like, and therefore sent
the master of the ship on that errand. Meanwhile, on
board the <i>Batavia</i> reigned a miniature pandemonium;
women were shrieking, children crying, grown men
were raving; and the ship was beginning to break up,
so that altogether poor Pelsart had his hands full, and
was relieved when the master returned and reported
favourably on the islands. There were, all told, 230
people on board, and, women and children going first,
120 were landed on the large island and forty on the
smaller one near at hand, leaving seventy still to be
landed. These also would have been rescued but for
the fact that the crew behaved as no sailors ever should;
they began to drink heavily, and got out of hand, for
which reason only a very few barrels of water were
landed, and twenty barrels of bread. Now, one would
imagine that a castaway crowd&#8217;s first thought would be
to conserve the food they had got, but this particular
crowd did quite the other thing, and began to waste
both food and water, with the result that one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
crew went back to the ship, by which Pelsart was still
standing, telling him not to send any more provisions
for a while. Pelsart therefore went ashore, leaving an
officer and seventy men on the ship.</p>

<p>Arrived on shore, the captain discovered that the tale
brought to him was quite correct; scarcely any water
was left. Resolved to make this good, he tried to return
to the ship to supervise the sending of further barrels;
but the weather had become too rough for him to
venture, and he had to hold back. Meanwhile, the
ship&#8217;s carpenter, taking his life in his hands, swam
ashore with the news that the ship&#8217;s crew on board
were in a pretty bad way, and that unless something
were done they would be all flung headlong into the
sea when the ship broke up. Pelsart, unable to go
himself, prevailed upon the carpenter to go back and
tell the crew to hold on a while, and busy themselves
with making rafts on which to float to shore. But
the crew, although they did all they could, were unable
to get to shore because the sea was now running
heavier than ever, and to trust oneself on the pounding
waves was to court disaster. Therefore they had to
remain on the wreck, while Pelsart fumed and fretted
at the thought of not being able to do anything for
them.</p>

<p>Neither the larger island nor the smaller one, on
which Pelsart himself was stranded, had any water besides
that which had been brought; and this was little
enough, in all conscience. The people who had been
so prodigal of it at the beginning now came to see
that without water they would surely perish. What
was to be done? Water they must have; and they
urged Pelsart to go to some of the neighbouring islands
in quest of it.</p>

<p>With a captain&#8217;s loyalty to his ship&#8217;s company,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Pelsart refused to go without the consent of all. Why
should he take the main chance of being able to get
away to safety while all the others remained stranded,
cast away without means of sustenance? No, if he
went at all, everyone must agree to his going. The
folk on the small island argued with him, but argued
in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over there,&#8221; he said, pointing to the larger
island, with its 120 poor souls, &#8220;and get their consent;
or else I&#8217;ll go back to the ship and perish with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying that, anyway; and so
they let him push off the boat, taking in her a crew
sufficient to work her. They were a wily clique, that
crew! When the captain got well away from the island
they refused to take him to the other island. They
feared, no doubt, that the people there would not agree
to Pelsart&#8217;s going, and they knew that out at sea
Pelsart was helpless against them. The captain raved,
threatened; but raved and threatened in vain. They
would not let him go, and when he jumped up and
made as though he would fling himself overboard and
swim back, they none too gently grabbed at him and
held him down by force.</p>

<p>Pelsart scowled and growled at his mutinous crew;
but neither black looks nor hard words moved them, and
eventually Pelsart had to come to an arrangement
whereby he agreed to go in search of water, provided
he received a manifesto, signed by all his men, approving
of this. Things being fixed up thus, the captain
at last set out on his quest; and a long, long quest it
proved to be.</p>

<p>Day after day he sailed amongst the islands, seeking
water, but finding none; and all the time the
supplies were running short. At last he resolved to
go farther afield, and struck off across the trackless sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and in a little while found himself off the coast of
Australia, then a continent without a shred of civilisation.
He hit the coast at the spot where Geraldton now
stands, and tried to put in at a small cove; surf, however,
romped at the boat, and flung her back each time
she pushed her nose shorewards. Pelsart at last gave
up in despair and sailed to the northwards, following
the coast, looking for a likely spot to land. In due
course this was found; but when they did land the men
found no water, and only succeeded in frightening a few
natives, who fled for their lives at the sight of the
strange white men. Off again, to land, probably, at
the North-West Cape, where they found water&mdash;rain
water! This was not at all hopeful, and, as the coast
had been trending away to the east, Pelsart determined
to strike north-east, where he knew lay Batavia, in Java.</p>

<p>Twenty-two days after leaving his shipwrecked
company Pelsart found himself at Batavia, having
sailed nearly sixteen hundred miles in an open boat.
At Batavia, in due course, Pelsart was able to obtain
a frigate, with which he set out to return for his
castaways.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, things were happening on the
islands away down south. And such things!</p>

<p>The men whom Pelsart had left on the wreck had
succeeded in getting off in safety after many days of
anxious waiting, and the last man to leave was the
supercargo, an ex-apothecary of Haarlem who rejoiced
in the name of Jerom Cornelis, and who had ambitions.
He wanted to be a pirate, and thought that he had
found a splendid opportunity. He worked out his plans
with delightful thoroughness. First he would kill off
all the honest men of the company, and then, having
formed his pirate crew, take the captain by surprise
when he came back, as he firmly believed he would.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Probably Cornelis&#8217;s further plans allowed for seizing
Pelsart&#8217;s boat, and sailing away with it until he came
up with some large vessel, whose crew his piratical
company would eventually succeed in overpowering,
when they would find themselves in possession of a ship
suitable for their purpose of scouring the seas.</p>

<p>But the first step was to get rid of the true men;
and as there seemed to be more of this calibre than
Cornelis felt he could deal with at one operation, he
resorted to an artful ruse. Forty men, under the chaplain
and a Mr. Weybhays, were dispatched to another
island in search of water, with instructions to light three
fires as a signal of success. The little band were successful,
and lighted their beacons as agreed. But there
was no answer!</p>

<p>What had happened? They were soon to know.
Even at the fair distance he was away Mr. Weybhays
could see that something untoward was taking place on
the island, and presently several men sprang into the
sea and began swimming towards him for dear life.
What a tale they told when they reached the island!
Hardly had Weybhays left when Cornelis and his
scoundrelly crew had begun to butcher the honest men
left behind, and had succeeded in killing nearly forty!
<i>Now</i> Weybhays knew why he had not received the
answering signal; he had evidently been sent off merely
to get rid of him and his company while the ex-apothecary
did his fell work, after which, no doubt,
their turn would come.</p>

<p>In this latter surmise Weybhays was right; but first
Pirate Cornelis had other fish to fry. Away on the
smaller island were some forty men who had been
landed before Pelsart departed, and Cornelis decided
to go over and wipe out all those who would not throw
in their lot with him. What he was afraid of was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
either party might be able to warn Pelsart on his return,
and thus frustrate Cornelis&#8217;s evil plan. So, without loss
of time, the pirates rowed over to the small island,
landed, and after a little trouble with the men, who did
not really want to die, succeeded in killing them off,
saving only seven youngsters and five women. On the
island, also, they found a number of chests which had
been washed ashore from the wreck, and these they
broke open. They were filled with rich apparel, and
the pirates bedecked themselves in wonderful attire,
Cornelis incidentally forming a bodyguard clothed in
scarlet livery. He felt almost a king, I&#8217;ll wager!</p>

<p>For some days the pirates had a gorgeous time,
drinking and rioting, for some of the rum casks had
been washed ashore. Then, considering it time he
got to pirate&#8217;s business again, the captain-general, as
he called himself, decided to tackle Weybhays and the
forty odd men he had with him. Gathering all the
arms he could find, Cornelis took twenty-two men with
him in two light shallops, and went over to settle
accounts with Weybhays.</p>

<p>Weybhays very nearly settled Cornelis, whose crew
got a good thrashing and put back to their island, a
sadder and angrier crowd. The pirate-in-chief, however,
refused to be scared, and, arming thirty-seven
men, went back to the attack. He wondered vaguely
why he had got beaten before, for Weybhays&#8217; men were
unarmed, except for roughly fashioned clubs, fitted with
long nails. Cornelis felt that it was a bad start for a
pirate gang, and determined to wipe the stain out.
Instead of which, when the second expedition got near
the island, Weybhays and his men, dashing out into
the water, fell upon the pirates with vigour, and, after
a fine scrimmage, succeeded in driving them back,
beaten a second time.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Weybhays and his men fell upon the pirates&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Cornelis felt hurt. He could see his plans being
altogether upset unless he could cope with Weybhays,
and clearly he and his dastardly crew were no match for
that fearless man and his gallant company when it came
to fighting. He must try other means; and try them
quickly, lest Pelsart return and Weybhays be able to
warn him.</p>

<p>Cornelis therefore thought of a scheme to outwit
Weybhays. Amongst the latter&#8217;s party were two
French soldiers, whom the pirate thought might be
willing to come to terms with him and play the traitor&mdash;if
he could but get into communication with them. He
opened up negotiations with Weybhays, hoping thereby
to be able to correspond with the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>He promised Weybhays that, if the latter would
return the boat he had, his party should not again be
attacked, and that some of the salvage from the
<i>Batavia</i> should be given up. Weybhays agreed to this
after a while, and Cornelis hugged himself as he
thought that, without a boat, Weybhays could not warn
Pelsart when he appeared; and he hugged himself more
when, during the negotiations, he succeeded in smuggling
letters to the Frenchmen, offering them six
thousand livres each if they would turn traitor to
Weybhays, who had insisted upon the treaty being
drawn up in proper order and being signed by both
parties.</p>

<p>The captain-general, sure in his own mind that the
Frenchmen could not resist the temptation of his gold,
waited serenely for the morning to come, when he was
to go over to Weybhays&#8217; island and sign the treaty;
but in the meantime the gallant French soldiers had
decided that it was better to be honest than to be
pirates, and they therefore warned Weybhays.</p>

<p>Morning came, and with it Cornelis and three or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
four of his men. He was in high spirits, anticipating
that he was about to get the better of Weybhays. Instead,
he received a shock. Weybhays, making no sign
that he knew aught of Cornelis&#8217;s stratagem, went down
to the beach and helped him run his boat up; and then,
before Cornelis knew what had happened, Weybhays
and his men fell upon him, knocked him on the head,
and put <i>hors de combat</i> two of his companions, the
others succeeding in escaping in the boat.</p>

<p>Poor old Cornelis! When he came round he found
himself trussed like a fowl for the cooking. Gone all
his lofty hopes, shattered all his ambitions. Weybhays
had triumphed.</p>

<p>But away on the other island Cornelis&#8217;s ruffianly
crew were plotting and planning on his behalf&mdash;also on
their own, by the way, for they felt that Cornelis was
the corner-stone of their own safety, and that unless
he were free they did not know how to cope with
Pelsart, should he return. So without delay they
tumbled into their boats and went over to Weybhays&#8217;
island, intending to do great deeds and rescue Cornelis.
Weybhays was ready for them, and sent them scuttling
off again&mdash;soundly beaten!</p>

<p>And then a frigate appeared on the horizon; and
though the pirates did not know it, albeit they made
a very good guess, Pelsart was standing on her deck,
looking across at the islands he had left so many days
ago. He was wondering what had happened during his
absence, whether his company were still alive, or
whether they had starved to death or died of thirst.
He little knew that there had been worse foes than
hunger and thirst at work!</p>

<p>Presently a column of smoke lifted its filmy head
over one of the islands, and Pelsart realised that some
at least still lived. A boat was lowered immediately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
filled with provisions, and Pelsart embarked in her
and started to make for the island. At the same instant
a small boat sped out from Weybhays&#8217; island; in her
was Weybhays, who, when he reached Pelsart&#8217;s boat,
hastily told the captain his story, and urged him to
return to the frigate, named the <i>Sardam</i>, lest the pirates
put out and overpower him.</p>

<p>Pelsart looked at Weybhays as though he were
bereft of his senses; but confirmation of his words was
soon forthcoming, for suddenly a couple of boats shot
out from the larger island, and began speeding towards
Pelsart&#8217;s boat. That was enough. Off went Pelsart
to the frigate, followed hard by Weybhays. It was a
race for life; and Pelsart won. Just as he had scrambled
aboard the pirate boats drew alongside.</p>

<p>And a gallant-looking crowd they were! Their
fanciful costumes showed signs of bad handling by
Weybhays, but their weapons&mdash;swords and pistols&mdash;looked
very workmanlike, and when Pelsart asked them
what they meant by daring to come near the ship in
such a condition, they replied that they would very
soon show him. And they began trying to board the
frigate.</p>

<p>Pelsart&#8217;s answer was quick and to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that gun?&#8221; he cried, pointing to one of
the frigate&#8217;s cannons, frowning down at them. &#8220;If
you don&#8217;t surrender&mdash;and at once&mdash;I&#8217;ll have it sink you
where you lay!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no arguing with that gun. The pirates
laid down their arms, very soon to be joined by their
whilom captain-general, and in a little while were on
board the <i>Sardam</i>&mdash;in irons. Their piracy had come to
an inglorious end.</p>

<p>That night the frigate lay off the islands, and next
day a boat was sent off to try conclusions with the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
of the mutineers, who, however, seeing that the
game was up, flung down their arms and surrendered.</p>

<p>There is little more to be told. The wreck was salved
of all that was valuable in her; the gold and silver that
Cornelis and his ruffians had purloined was collected
and taken on board the <i>Sardam</i>, where, of course, the
remainder of Weybhays&#8217; company had already found
quarters. And then Pelsart held a court. Cornelis and
his would-be pirates were tried, and executed on the
spot. It was no time for delay, because the <i>Sardam</i>
contained a goodly treasure, and to keep Cornelis
would be to run the risk of the ambitious scoundrel
breaking out again. Then Pelsart weighed anchor and
went his way, after a series of adventures such as seldom
fall to a man&#8217;s lot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADRIFT WITH MADMEN</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Burning of the &#8220;Columbian,&#8221; and the Sequel</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON May 3, 1914, there flashed across the ether a
wireless message, picked up at Sable Island, as
brief as it was dramatic: &#8220;Hurry up! We are on
fire!&#8221; No ship&#8217;s name was given, nor indication as
to position, and the world held its breath and wondered.</p>

<p>Then, two days later, the Cunard liner <i>Franconia</i>
picked up a boat containing thirteen survivors from the
steamer <i>Columbian</i>; and as they had been adrift since
the 3rd, a connection was at once seen between the
faint, incoherent wireless message and the <i>Columbian</i>.
A little later the <i>Manhattan</i> rescued fourteen more
<i>Columbian</i> survivors, including Captain McDonald,
from whom it was found that yet a third boat, with
sixteen men, was missing. Immediately all the ships
round about were notified, and a search was prosecuted;
but it was not until thirteen days after the disaster that
the boat was found, and in her were only five men.
The rest had died.</p>

<p>Behind this epitome there is one of the great tragic
stories of the sea.</p>

<p>It was during the night that, with startling suddenness,
there was a terrific explosion which shook the ship
from stem to stern. First Officer Tiere, whose watch it
was, instantly gave the fire call, and the crew&mdash;some of
whom were asleep, others at their posts of duty&mdash;rushed
up on deck. Smoke issued from below, and told them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
what had happened. Then there was another mighty
explosion, in the coal bunkers this time, and the whole
deck was ripped up as though it had been made of tin-foil.
There followed clap after clap, as hatches were
burst open by other explosions, and in an incredibly
short time the whole ship was one blazing mass. So
instantaneously had the calamity fallen upon them that
there was no time to lose, no time even to dress or to
put sufficient provisions into the boats, which were
immediately lowered. Men, scantily attired, some only
in vests and pants, tumbled into them, and strong backs
bent to the oars, seeking to pull away from the terrific
heat and to get out of the range of danger from the
ship, which seemed as though she must soon go down.</p>

<p>What followed was a nightmare&mdash;especially for those
in First Officer Tiere&#8217;s boat, the story of which is to
be told here. She carried sixteen souls, with only a
twenty-gallon cask of water and a tank of biscuits to
last them till&mdash;till they were picked up. In these days,
when the seas are ploughed by thousands of ships, it
seems incredible that a boat should be at the mercy of
wind and wave for many days before being picked up;
but it is always the unlikely thing that happens, and
these castaways little realised how long it was to be
before they were rescued. Soon it seemed to them
as though rescue would never come. But that is
anticipating.</p>

<p>When the boat pushed off from the flaming
<i>Columbian</i> there was a strong southerly wind blowing,
which carried them to the northward. They had no
navigating instruments on board, and the weather was
misty; they were thus helpless in their endeavours to
keep in the track of shipping, on which their sole chance
of rescue depended.</p>

<p>Anxious eyes peered through the darkness to catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
glimpses of passing lights; at any moment they knew
that some mighty leviathan might push out of the
blackness, and smash into their frail craft before they
could cry aloud, even if their voices would be heard
above the noise. Fortunately this did not happen, and
towards morning their eyes were gladdened by the
gleam of lights in the distance, coming nearer and
nearer. Salvation was at hand, they told themselves,
and hunted about, seeking matches, so that they might
give a feeble light to the racing greyhound. But not
a dry match could they find; a great sea had been
shipped as the boat was lowered, and every match was
useless.</p>

<p>Torn with agony, those sixteen men stood up in
their boat and screamed themselves hoarse, hoping
against hope that the sound would carry to the big
ship, which, because of her size, they believed was the
liner <i>Olympic</i>. But, though they yelled till their voices
cracked and they were exhausted, no sign came that
they had been heard, and the <i>Olympic</i>, a floating,
gleaming palace, passed them by.</p>

<p>Despair now seized them; but, as the grey fingers
of the dawn crept up, they took heart again, believing
that they could not be passed by in daylight as they
had been in the darkness. They were to be disillusioned
once more, for presently they saw, about six or seven
miles away, a large tramp steamer, to which they
signalled frantically, using Tiere&#8217;s raincoat on an oar to
wave with. They waved till their arms ached, taking
it in turn; but the tramp passed on, and left them
despondent, crazed.</p>

<p>During the afternoon hope was born afresh; away&mdash;far
away&mdash;they saw a big liner heave in sight, and
then come to a standstill. Eyes strained across the
water, and presently the castaways realised that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
new-comer was taking a boat on board; and they came
to the only conclusion possible, that one of the other
lifeboats, more fortunate than they, had been noticed.
Strange as it may seem in the reading, and tragic in
the event to those who watched, the rescue ship saw
them not, although she steamed away in a circle, as
though looking out for any other waifs. She was the
<i>Franconia</i>, and her human salvage was thirteen souls,
while within a few miles of her there tossed a boat with
sixteen men on board, who cried in their anguish as
they saw her steam off, their hopes dashed for the third
time.</p>

<p>First Officer Tiere now found plenty of work to do.
The sea was very rough, and the lifeboat pitched and
rolled dangerously. There was no fear of her sinking,
because she was fitted with air-tanks, but the ever-present
danger was that she would be overturned as
the great seas played shuttlecock with her. The men
worked hard at baling her out; and then, to give her
some sort of steadiness, rigged up a sea anchor out
of oars and old canvas, and so held her head to the
seas. All the time a sharp look-out was kept for signs
of vessels, but none was seen, and Tiere, realising how
serious things were getting, apportioned the rations.
The water was allotted out&mdash;a pint a day per man, with
a biscuit per meal; and for a week they subsisted on
this fare, thinking themselves fortunate. Then the
water began to give out, and the portion was reduced.
But economy in this direction meant suffering; the men,
weak and faint from want of food, parched with thirst,
became delirious; and although there was some rain
on Thursday, the 7th, and some more on the following
Monday, it did not increase their water-supply sufficiently
to make any difference.</p>

<p>And some of the men, maddened with thirst, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to drinking sea-water. It was the beginning of the end.
One man died, mad, on the 11th, and they dropped
him overboard, Tiere saying what part of the burial
service he could remember. Next day another man
died, and two more on the following morning&mdash;all of
them victims to their insatiable thirst, which grew more
maddening as, against all advice, they swallowed great
gulps of sea-water.</p>

<p>Tiere, fighting for their lives, when they would not
fight themselves, commandeered the sole dipper they
had in the boat, so that they could not drink so much;
then, when, exhausted, he would lie down to snatch a
few hours&#8217; sleep, they would creep round him and steal
the dipper, and drink the water that meant death until
he awoke and fought for the cup. Whereupon, with
the pangs of thirst eating into their very vitals, the
raving men, shouting curses at him for his interference,
and defying him to stop them, would lean over the
gunwales and lap up the water like dogs.</p>

<p>Then came delirium; raving, cursing, struggling
mad they went. And then into the Great Unknown,
singing in their madness.</p>

<p>Even the men who contented themselves with the
small portion of fresh water which Tiere had allotted
to them, even these knew the agonies of that dreadful
voyage, which was leading nowhere; mists and fogs
hung around them all day; the cold winds of night
blew upon them and, in their weakened strength, sapped
at the very roots of their life.</p>

<p>Thus the nightmare held on, with death and awful
suffering to make these unfortunate men sure that it
was real. They were almost foodless now, as well as
waterless.</p>

<p>On the Friday there came the most tragic incident
of all: Jakob, a big Russian, an oiler of the <i>Columbian</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
thrown off his balance by thirst, had imbibed great
quantities of salt water. The effects soon began to show
themselves, and Jakob, a raving maniac, sat in the
bow of the boat with an axe in his hand, vowing he
would kill the whole crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to shore&mdash;getta drink,&#8221; he cried, and
the fear-stricken men expected every moment to see him
hurl himself overboard. Instead, he sat muttering
foolishly, toying with the axe they dreaded, leering
viciously at them, gesticulating savagely. Tiere,
weakened, emaciated, staggered along towards the six-foot
Russian; he must get that axe away. There was
a mist before his eyes, a vagueness in his mind, and
a half-formed thought that somehow the Russian would
bring the end sooner were he not disarmed. He talked
to him, hardly knowing what he said, bullied him,
coaxed him, humoured him, while the crew looked on
in anxiety; and the madman at last gave up the axe.
Then Tiere made him lie down, settled him as comfortably
as possible, and himself went to snatch a little
sleep, of which he was sorely in need.</p>

<p>For a while all was still; darkness was now upon
them; only the howl of the wind and the lap, lap of
the water against the sides broke the silence. Then
slowly along the boat there crept a dark form, with
madness in its eyes; it was Jakob, and in his hands he
carried the boat stretcher. He was making aft to where
the other men were, intent on killing them all. Fortunately
someone saw him coming, and instantly all
were alert, ready for him.</p>

<p>Cursing in Russian and broken English, Jakob
hurled himself upon them, vowing to murder them all.
He wanted the water that was left, and he would have
it. Aye, he would have it! The wretched men,
gathering up the remnants of their once full-blooded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
strength, tackled him bravely, wrenching the stretcher
away and seeking to tie him up. How they fought,
to the danger of being pitched overboard to death, and
with the prospect of being kicked to pulp by the
Russian&#8217;s heavy boots! It was like a scene from some
book of wild adventure, that fight in so strange a setting;
yet to these men it was real, and life and death
hung upon its issue. There was no light by which to
see whether one struck friend or foe, only the curses
of the Russian to show when a blow landed upon him;
and the night was made hideous by yells as the frenzied
men struggled madly for control. At last it was over:
the giant lay inert in the bottom of the boat, tied securely
and lashed to a thwart, where for five or six hours he
lay screaming, cursing, struggling to release himself,
and then died.</p>

<p>Despair&mdash;it is a feeble word to describe their feelings&mdash;was
now upon the remaining men, who for
another week were tossed about, hither and thither,
until they had lost all count of their bearings. The
sun kept behind the clouds, and fogs and mists enwrapped
them in their wet, cold folds. In one sense
this was a blessing in disguise; it kept the pangs of
thirst under somewhat. But as they shivered in the
bottom of the boat, huddling together to keep each
other warm, they were in no mood to thank Heaven for
fogs which they knew hid them from passing vessels.
By Saturday morning eleven men had died and been
thrown overboard, and the five survivors looked dumbly
at each other, reading in bleared eyes the question,
&#8220;Whose turn next?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the turn of Peter Preive, the mess-room
steward, of whom a strange story is told. Before he
left Antwerp on the <i>Columbian</i> he had dreamed a dream&mdash;that
he would be a fortnight adrift in an open boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
before he died. On the morning of the thirteenth
day Preive lay at the point of death, for the hundredth
time telling his comrades his dream and assuring them
they would be picked up on the morrow.</p>

<p>It sounds like fiction, but it is solid fact, and those
mariners took heart of courage: if some parts of the
dream had come true, why not another? And so they
lived on, as they had for some days past, with Preive&#8217;s
dream as encouragement, though they could not altogether
look with equanimity upon the prospect before
them; ere the fourteenth day dawned some of those
five that remained might have gone to join their
comrades!</p>

<p>They had been reduced now to trying to make a
paste out of the boot leather and the remains of the
biscuits&mdash;anything to stave off hunger. But even their
craving stomachs could not take kindly to the mixture,
and the men knew that they were now face to face with
death at last. They looked in the biscuit tank again,
and found there&mdash;crumbs, simply a few crumbs, which
they scooped up in order to mix some more of the
unpalatable paste. And then, like a messenger of hope,
they saw a smudge on the horizon, watched it grow
larger and denser, saw the hull of a ship grow out of
the mist. Four of them yelled themselves hoarse again,
waved their signal, took out their oars and tugged away
at them like mad. They bent their backs to the work,
they pulled till their arms ached, and got hardly any
way on her; they were too weak to pull against the sea
effectively. Then the big ship stopped, and they saw
her taking some soundings. She got up steam again
and moved forward; and the castaways knew that they
had been seen.</p>

<p>The reaction set in; the men who had borne up
for thirteen days against hunger, thirst, who had fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
against madness and death, crumpled up and fell in
the bottom of their boat. They were done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the big ship was punching her way
towards them. She was the <i>Seneca</i> (Captain Johnson),
who had been searching for the missing lifeboat for
many days, having crossed from the spot where the
<i>Columbian</i> burnt out to Nova Scotia and back time
after time without sighting the unfortunate men. The
captain had, indeed, given up hope of ever finding
them; and when the look-out sighted the boat, and the
<i>Seneca</i> plunged towards her at full steam, Captain
Johnson scarcely believed it possible that anyone could
be alive in her.</p>

<p>When they came up with her they saw the five men
lying in the bottom of the boat, helpless, emaciated,
eyes sunken, bodies trembling. Preive, alive when the
<i>Seneca</i> came up, died from the shock of the sight of
her; Tiere, who had commanded all through, and had
done much to encourage the others, tried to lift himself
up, but fell back exhausted, and the other four living
men had to be helped out of their boat.</p>

<p>Their cruise was at an end. They were saved; but
the terror of it will never leave them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FRANCIS DRAKE&#8217;S RAID ON THE
SPANISH MAIN</h2>


<p class="ph1">How Drake Took Toll for Spanish Treachery</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN 1567 Francis Drake had accompanied John
Hawkins on a slave-trading expedition to the
Spanish Main; the worthy pair had gone across to
Africa, where they had captured a number of Africans,
whom they shipped to the West to sell as slaves, seeing
that the Spaniards were sorely in need of labourers.
Now, it was a maxim with the Dons that the Wealthy
West was for Spaniards only, and they very much resented
the coming of the Englishmen, so that, while
professing the desire to trade with them, they really
played them false; and it was only by the skin of their
teeth that Hawkins and Drake managed to escape to
England, even then having to leave a number of their
men in the hands of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Drake was angry. He vowed vengeance. Henceforth
he determined not to go on trading expeditions,
but to sally forth to the Spanish Main to take toll of
the riches that the Spaniards were harvesting year by
year. He did nothing in a hurry; he worked things
out, went on a voyage or so to get the lie of the land,
and in 1572 left Plymouth&mdash;bound for Panama! On
one of his previous voyages he had laid up stores at
a place on the mainland which he had called Port
Pheasant, because he had seen a great number of those
birds flying about there. Arrived at Port Pheasant on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
this new voyage, he received a mild sort of shock.
Nailed to a tree was a leaden letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Captain Drake</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>If you have fortune to come into the port, make
haste away, for the Spaniards which you had with you
last year have betrayed this place, and taken away all that
you left here. I departed hence this present 7th of July,
1572.</i></p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;<i>Your loving friend</i>,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">John Garret</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Now, although Drake knew the seriousness of the
position, he refused to be frightened away. He had
work to do&mdash;the fitting up of his pinnaces&mdash;and he
resolved to do this before leaving. He therefore set
his men to work, and in a week was ready to sail for
Nombre de Dios, his first place of call on the Spaniards.
Just as he was about to start there came to the port
an English barque commanded by Captain James
Rouse, who threw in his lot&mdash;and his thirty-eight men&mdash;with
Drake; and the company set sail for Nombre
de Dios. At a small island called the Isle of Pines
they stopped a while, and Drake appealed to the
cupidity of his men, in the hope of making them even
firmer than ever in their determination to do their
utmost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrades,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;before us lies the world&#8217;s
treasure-house. You are brave; and with your help
I am confident of success. Follow me, and yours shall
be the Spaniard&#8217;s wealth; yours shall be the fame that
comes from great deeds, and we shall be able to take
to your Queen much treasure and have good stores for
ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>That put good heart into his men, and when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
came to Nombre de Dios they were ready for anything,
although they murmured, some of them, against attacking
in daylight, as was Drake&#8217;s intention. However,
Drake had to alter his plans, for when they came into
the harbour they found a big ship there. Someone
aboard saw them, and the vessel was headed for the
shore to give the alarm. The English soon stopped
her little game; the pinnaces raced after her, headed
her off to seaward, and then, feeling safe, the men
landed, fondly believing that they were unnoticed.</p>

<p>They were mistaken. While the rest of the
garrison slept or made merry, or were on guard to
landward against an attack from Cimaroons, one gunner
was at his post in the fort. One gunner, one shot,
and the town was in alarm; and away went the Spaniard
racing into the town to tell of the coming of the hated
English. There ensued a hubbub in Nombre de Dios;
bells rang out their tocsin call, trumpets blared, drums
rolled, and men rallied up to withstand the foe. As
for Drake, he grasped the situation promptly, and had
his plan working without delay. He divided his men
into two companies, leading one himself and sending
the other forward under his brother John and John
Oxenham, hoping by this means to delude the
Spaniards into thinking that a large force had come
against them.</p>

<p>It was a queer scene. Every man Jack of Drake&#8217;s
companies carried a firepike, whose flaming torch lit
up the place weirdly; they made unearthly noises on
trumpets, and rent the air with war-cries which struck
terror into the Spaniards. So much so that, hearing
the advance of men from two quarters, the Dons,
forgetting all about the treasure in their stores, took to
their heels and ran for dear life.</p>

<p>It was all so easy, thought the Englishmen; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
then found they had counted their chickens before they
were hatched, for when they reached the market-place
they saw that the Spaniards had taken new courage
and had massed themselves for a gallant fight. Moreover,
they, too, had resorted to a stratagem; they had
strung a line of lights across the dark street, and made
it appear that there were many, many men with torches
awaiting the foe!</p>

<p>Nothing loath to accept a good fight, Drake&#8217;s men
plunged in; and although the Dons met them boldly
and fought well, nothing could stop the men out for
treasure and revenge. Using their firepikes as weapons,
they charged the Spaniards, and although Drake and
others were wounded, and the trumpeter was killed,
they put the Dons to flight, and found themselves
in possession of Nombre de Dios, with the treasure of
King Philip theirs for the taking!</p>

<p>They hurried to the governor&#8217;s house, where they
saw much treasure in the form of stacks of silver bars;
they marched to the treasure-house, which Drake
ordered them to force open. They proceeded to do so.
But just then a terrific thunderstorm broke over the
town; the men were drenched to the skin, their bows,
with which they had done good work in the attack,
were loosened and rendered useless, so that they began
to fear lest the Spaniards, whom they could hear massing
on the hills after their flight, should burst down
upon them, when they would be practically powerless
against them.</p>

<p>They spoke of going back to the boats, but Drake,
who heard them, chaffed them for their cowardice. He
knew it wasn&#8217;t that!</p>

<p>&#8220;You would fly!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;On the very threshold
of the world&#8217;s treasure-house you would fly! I have
brought you to the mouth of the treasury of the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
which if you do not gain none but yourselves will be
to blame! Break open the treasure-house!&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting to see if they followed he
sprang at the door to set them the example; but even
as he did so his sight failed him, the strength which had
been ebbing with the flow of the blood from his wound
gave out, and he fell, a crumpled heap, at the threshold!</p>

<p>Instantly all were alarmed, and they fell to binding
up his wound. That done, they urged him to come
away. But Drake refused to budge; whereupon, knowing
how much depended upon his safety, they picked
him up in their strong arms and carried him to his
pinnace. Not all his entreaties or threats could move
them, and the only satisfaction he could get out of
them was:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good of the treasure of the Spanish
Main if we have not Francis Drake?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it was that Drake found himself back in his
pinnace, heading out for sea. But the night&#8217;s adventures
were by no means over. In the harbour they
found a big ship coming in. They promptly boarded
her and took her, finding her to be well stocked with
wines and other good things; and, taking her along
with them, they made their way to a small island a
little distance from Nombre de Dios, where they rested
and refreshed themselves.</p>

<p>The Spaniards discovered where they were, and sent
a messenger to Drake; they wanted to make sure who
had attacked them. Drake received the emissary
courteously, answered his questions frankly, assured
him that the English arrows were not poisoned, and
that he was indeed Francis Drake; gave him a present
for himself, and then sent him back with a message
to the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to keep his eyes open, for if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
God lend me life and leave I mean to reap some of
your harvest which you get out of the earth and send
into Spain to trouble all the earth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Away went the Spaniard and delivered his message,
no doubt to the consternation of the Governor.</p>

<p>In a couple of days Drake felt that it was time to
go to the Isle of Pines, where he had left Rouse and his
men. Arrived here, he told of his misadventures, and
Rouse, growing disheartened, washed his hands of the
whole affair and went home; which Drake didn&#8217;t really
mind, for he preferred to work on his own, and was by
no means despondent. He decided that he would tackle
Carthagena, the chief town on the Spanish Main, which,
if he could surprise it, would amply repay him for his
voyage.</p>

<p>The Governor of Nombre de Dios, however, had
taken the precaution of warning Carthagena of the
proximity of the Dragon, as they called Drake now,
so that when the English appeared off Carthagena they
were met by shots from the town, which told Drake that
his surprise attack would not come off. He knew, too,
that the town was too strong to attempt to assault it
openly, so he contented himself with seizing a number
of ships lying at anchor in the harbour&mdash;right under
the noses of the Spanish guns.</p>

<p>Then he sailed from Carthagena, deciding to lie
low awhile in the Gulf of Darien till the excitement had
subsided, when he would sally forth again. One thing
worried him: he hadn&#8217;t sufficient men to man the ships
and the pinnaces. He resolved to get over the difficulty
by sinking one ship&mdash;the <i>Swan</i>&mdash;commanded by his
brother John. He had to do this secretly, for he knew
that his men would never consent to her being sunk.
So, taking old Tom Moore, his carpenter, into his
confidence, he succeeded in overcoming his qualms and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
arranging for him to bore holes in the ship&#8217;s bottom;
and in due course the <i>Swan</i> began to fill and to settle
down. Drake, passing by in one of his pinnaces, asked
John what was the matter with his ship; had she
sprung a leak? Instantly it was &#8220;All hands to the
pumps!&#8221; But pumped they never so quickly the water
gained, and soon the men had to abandon the ship,
which presently plunged beneath the surface; and Drake
had achieved his purpose.</p>

<p>Then away to the Gulf of Darien, where they rested
and amused themselves at various good old English
games. Here Drake learnt from a negro he had with
him, one Diego, that the Cimaroons, who hated the
Spaniards like poison, would no doubt be willing to join
forces with him against them; and Drake sent his brother
John to the mainland to negotiate with the Cimaroons.
The mission was successful, and John returned to report
that the Cimaroons, eager to take their vengeance on
the Spaniards for all the evil they had wrought, would
be willing to co-operate with the English, and would
lead them anywhere they liked. Drake, following the
counsel of the Cimaroons, decided to postpone operations
until the rainy season was over. Now, as the waiting
period had to be filled in somehow, or his men would
grow weary of waiting, Drake, knowing that inactivity
is the worst thing for sailors and soldiers, determined
to be up and doing on the sea. So, moving to a safer
harbour, he made that his headquarters, leaving there
a number of men under command of John. With the
remainder he set out in a couple of pinnaces to see
what was to be picked up along the coast. First he
dashed into Carthagena harbour, and cut out two
frigates from under the muzzles of the guns; later, when
the Spaniards grew weary of being at the mercy of the
Dragon, and sent out two big ships to take him, Drake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
met them, and though they were well armed and well
manned he sent them scurrying back to their harbour.
One of his two prizes he sent to the bottom, and the
other he burnt; and then, wanting to feel terra firma
beneath his feet, pulled to the shore. Something told
him that the Spaniards had prepared an ambush for
him; but Drake determined to land, and, springing
ashore, he defied the hidden Spaniards to do their
worst! And instead of doing that they bolted!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, John Drake had been busy. He did
not want to be out of all the fun, so one day, espying
a Spanish ship, he put off in a pinnace, taking only
one man with him, and tried to capture her. The
result was a foregone conclusion&mdash;both the intrepid and
foolhardy Englishmen were killed. John was never
so lucky as Francis!</p>

<p>Thus it came about that when Drake returned to
his headquarters to give his men a rest he found his
brother gone, and suffered an agony of spirit, for the
hardy mariner had loved his brave brother. Still, what
is done cannot be undone, and the Englishmen had to
resign themselves to fate. The hot weather having
now set in, they had other troubles to think about;
fever had laid its fell grip upon them, and took a heavy
toll during the time of rest. Then came the Cimaroons
with news of the Spanish fleet. This heralded the
dispatch of the treasure from Panama across the Isthmus
of Darien&mdash;a journey which up till then had been unattended
by danger from a European foe, although now
and again, no doubt, the Cimaroons had sought to get
a blow in at the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Drake now intended to give the Dons a shock; he
meant to march inland and waylay the treasure mule-train.
He had only eighteen of his men who were fit
to travel, but he picked out thirty Cimaroons and Pedro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to go with him. Pedro, by the way, had whetted the
curiosity of Drake by telling him of a great sea far
away beyond the hills, and the adventurer told himself
that this must be the wonderful South Sea of which the
men of the past had spoken. He decided to have a
look at it, with a view to future exploring.</p>

<p>So off across the isthmus went the little band of
black men and white&mdash;strange companions, who had at
least one bond of sympathy, namely, hatred of the
Spaniards. The Cimaroons knew the way, and led by
the most favourable route&mdash;through forests and over
hills and across rivers. On every side were new and
strange sights to the Englishmen, who marched by day,
and slept by night in branch-houses built by the
Cimaroons to shelter them from the mists which bring
fever.</p>

<p>After a fairly uneventful journey, the company
arrived at the other side of the isthmus, and found
before them a high mountain, up which they toiled, to
see, as Pedro had told them, the great sea. The summit
being reached, they saw that on a tree-trunk the
Cimaroons had cut steps, and in its branches had
erected a platform. Drake clambered up to this, and
stood there facing the sea&mdash;the mighty Pacific rolling
before him, the great Atlantic spread out behind him.
He had come within sight of the South Sea&mdash;the first
Englishman to do so.</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s silence. The sight seemed too much
for the adventurer; then, bursting out a vow that he
would be the first Englishman to sail its waters, he
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;But one thing do I ask of Heaven, and that to sail
once in an English ship in that sea!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, having feasted his eyes upon the scene before
him, he called up his company, and there, one by one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the English sailors registered their vows to follow
him wherever he went, and when.</p>

<p>But there was no time to dally. Pressing work must
be attended to; the future must be left to itself. So
away towards Panama City Drake and his men went,
cutting their way through the forest and keeping a
good look-out lest they be surprised by Spaniards.
However, they escaped notice, and after two days&#8217; hard
work came to open country, and before them lay
Panama, the city of gold and silver; and away in the
harbour rode the treasure fleet, waiting to disgorge its
rich cargoes.</p>

<p>The day was still young when they came within
sight of their objective, and, knowing that they must
not be seen yet, Drake kept his men under cover until
night, meanwhile sending a Cimaroon to spy out the
land and to discover when the treasure-train would set
out on its journey to Nombre de Dios.</p>

<p>Anxiously the adventurers waited, longing to get to
business, wondering whether it might happen that they
would have to wait hidden very long. But presently
the spy came back with news that cheered, and made
them feel that they had the treasure in their hands
already! That very night the treasure-train was to set
out for Nombre de Dios&mdash;a train of fifty mules, heavy
laden, to be followed the next night by two other trains
of like size. How those Englishmen&#8217;s fingers itched!</p>

<p>But they knew there would be stern work before
them ere their hands laid hold on the treasure, and,
wasting no time on anticipatory visions, they marched
forward through the darkness till they came to the junction
of the Nombre de Dios and Panama roads. Here
Drake disposed his forces carefully, dividing them into
two companies of eight Englishmen and fifteen
Cimaroons&mdash;a company on each side of the road, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
command of Drake and John Oxenham respectively.
The companies were posted, not exactly opposite each
other, but in such positions that one could seize the
hindmost mules and the other the foremost, and so get
the Spaniards between two fires.</p>

<p>There followed an anxious time of waiting, during
which a man dared hardly breathe, let alone speak.
Then through the night air came the cheery tinkling of
bells, and they knew that the train was approaching.
The only thing that worried them was that the tinkling
came from two ways&mdash;from Venta Cruz and from
Panama. They knew that the treasure-train would not
come from Venta Cruz; but the question was which
would get there first?</p>

<p>They needn&#8217;t have worried; the whole matter was
settled for them! One of Drake&#8217;s men had been drinking
too much, and the neat brandy had got into his
head; so that when he heard the bells he got muddled
and lost his sense of locality. When the bells from
Venta Cruz drew nearer he thought they were the bells
from Panama. Now, the former heralded only the
approach of a single Spanish officer, who would have
been allowed to proceed without molestation had not
the drunken sailor raised himself up from the long grass
to hurl himself at the Spaniard. Quick as lightning
a Cimaroon hauled him back. But too late; the officer
had seen the white shirt which the man wore&mdash;as did
his comrades, for identification&mdash;and, suspicious that
there should be anyone lying in wait at such a spot,
and at such a time, he urged his mule on towards
Panama at top speed, expecting to be followed.</p>

<p>But none followed him; for Drake&#8217;s orders were to
lie low, even now.</p>

<p>On, therefore, went the officer, to meet the treasure-train,
which was in charge of the Treasurer of Lima,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
who was naturally pretty startled to see the galloping
figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;A miracle has happened!&#8221; cried the officer. &#8220;El
Dragon has come&mdash;though how, Heaven only knows&mdash;and
he lies in wait for the treasure!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, the Treasurer of Lima, like most of his compatriots,
had a wholesome dread of Drake, and
though it passed his comprehension that such a thing
should have taken place, yet he considered it wise to
adopt precautionary measures, lest there should be any
truth in the scared officer&#8217;s apparently wild tale.</p>

<p>So, keeping back the actual treasure-train, he sent
on a line of mules, two of them with loads of silver, the
rest with provisions, just to act as a decoy; and Drake,
having kept his men quiet, and hearing the tinkling
of the bells as before, imagined that everything was
going quite smoothly, and that after all the Spanish
officer had not seen the drunken sailor.</p>

<p>The mule-train came to the ambush; there rang
a shrill whistle-call, and the Englishmen and the
Cimaroons leapt to their feet, fell upon the Spaniards,
seized the mules, and began to rifle their packs, expecting
to find a rich haul of treasure.</p>

<p>And all they found were the two loads of silver
and an assortment of victuals!</p>

<p>However, there it was; and the important thing was
to square things up somehow, and to get back to the
coast before the Spaniards could stop them. The way
back lay through Venta Cruz. It was the easier way,
and Drake vowed he&#8217;d go by that road, even though it
meant fighting his way through. He must hurry on
before the men of Panama had time to warn Venta Cruz.
The Cimaroons pledged themselves to follow him
through thick and thin, and with this assurance Drake
immediately set out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The Cimaroons went on in front as scouts, and
presently reported that they had located the presence of
Spanish troops by the smell of the gun-matches. Whereupon
Drake got ready to fight, thinking he might have to
cut his way through. On they went, silently, carefully;
but soon the Spaniards saw them, and they were
challenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Englishmen!&#8221; came back the bold, proud, staggering
answer that wellnigh sent the Spaniards fleeing for
their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of the King of Spain, yield!&#8221; cried
the captain of the troop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; bellowed Drake. &#8220;For the honour of
the Queen of England, I must have passage this way,&#8221;
and discharged his pistol full at the captain. Then,
with good Queen Bess&#8217;s name on their lips, the
English opened fire upon the Spaniards, who responded
promptly, with fatal effect to one Englishman and
wounds to others, including Drake himself. Still the
little band kept up their fire, and presently the Spanish
fire slackened somewhat, and Drake&#8217;s whistle sounded
the &#8220;Charge!&#8221; There was a sharp volley of English
shot, a flight of Cimaroon arrows, and then &#8220;St. George
and England!&#8221; yelled the English, &#8220;Yo peho, yo
peho!&#8221; cried the Cimaroons, and away they went at
the Spaniards, scattering them, sending them helter-skelter
into Venta Cruz, whither the foe followed them&mdash;into
the heart of the city!</p>

<p>And that little mixed band captured Venta Cruz, and
ransacked it! But for all their roughness and eagerness
for treasure, the English behaved, as Englishmen always
do&mdash;courteously; and neither women nor children nor
unarmed men had aught to say against them for their
treatment.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;&#8216;For the honour of the Queen of England, I must have passage this way!&#8217; cried Drake, and discharged
his pistol&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Staying only long enough to take what treasure they
could find, Drake and his men pushed on from Venta
Cruz towards the coast, which they reached in due
course, to find the sick men well, though it was but
natural they were all downcast at the failure of the
journey to Panama.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Drake joined hands with a French
privateer, and proceeded to make other plans for capturing
some of the treasure from the South. He knew
that by this time the Spanish Main would be up in
arms and watchful against him; but he had come a
long way, and felt he ought to be paid for his trouble.</p>

<p>Oxenham was sent with a pinnace to cut out a
provision ship; which he did, capturing a fine frigate
laden with sufficient food to serve their purpose. Drake
himself went along the coast towards Veragua, stopping
a frigate on the way, relieving her of some of her
treasure, and gathering from the captain&mdash;probably
under pressure&mdash;that in the harbour at Veragua there
rode a Spanish ship with over a million of gold in her
hold. This was fine news indeed, and off to Veragua
hastened Drake, staying for nothing.</p>

<p>The pinnace shot into the harbour&mdash;and received
a broadside from the Spaniards, who were warned of
their coming! Back went Drake. Clearly, his luck
was out!</p>

<p>But he would have one more try. He discovered
that a treasure-train was due at Nombre de Dios from
Venta Cruz, and he made up his mind to make an attempt
to intercept this near Nombre de Dios. Putting back to
his harbour, he boarded his little fleet, consisting of the
French privateer and a couple of frigates captured from
the Spaniards. The <i>Pacha</i>, his own ship, was unseaworthy
by this time, and he left her &#8220;to the
Spaniards&#8221; as something in return for those he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
captured! Sailing along the coast for another harbour,
he left his vessels there, and embarked in his pinnaces
with fifteen Englishmen, twenty Frenchmen, and a
number of Cimaroons. On March 31 he landed the
majority of his forces at a river near Nombre de Dios,
leaving the remainder to watch the pinnaces.</p>

<p>Striking inland, the mixed band came within easy
distance of Nombre de Dios, and took up positions
along the road, waiting for the coming of the treasure-train
as they had waited before. Across the still night
air came the sounds of carpenters hard at work repairing
the ships which awaited the treasure for King
Philip; and then, just at the break of day, there came
the tinkle of bells&mdash;the sweetest of music to the adventurers&#8217;
ears!</p>

<p>They could hardly believe their eyes; coming towards
them were 190 mules, heavily laden, as the
Cimaroons had told them, with gold and silver&mdash;so
much that they wouldn&#8217;t know what to do with it!
Thirty tons of silver and gold awaited the taking&mdash;when
they had disposed of the guard of forty-five
Spanish soldiers.</p>

<p>Drake&#8217;s whistle rang shrilly again, and on the
instant the raiders were amongst the Spaniards, who,
fighting bravely, kept their attackers busy for a while.
But the allies were not to be daunted, and presently
the Spaniards, thinking discretion the better part of
valour, took to their heels and ran.</p>

<p>Letting them go, Drake and his men fell upon
the mule-trains and, tearing open the packs, found that
this time the lines had fallen in good places for them.
There was so much treasure, they could not carry it all!
They, therefore, hurriedly hid about fifteen tons of it
in the burrows of land crabs, in the bottom of a shallow
river, under trees&mdash;anywhere they could think of; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
every man carrying as much as he could bear of gold,
they started for the coast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the scared Spaniards had given the alarm
in Nombre de Dios, and while the raiders hurried off
with the loads, troops were sent out after them. Coming
up with the deserted and rifled treasure-train, they rejoiced
to find some of the mules still laden, and these
they sent into the city while they looked about them,
knowing that the Englishmen could not have taken
all the rest away. They discovered many of the hiding-places,
and seeing that they had succeeded in locating
the major portion of the treasure, they contented themselves
with gathering it up (employing 2,000 Mamoras
and negroes to do this), and sending it post-haste to
Nombre de Dios, preferring not to go after the bold
raiders.</p>

<p>Drake, meantime, was hastening to the coast, where
he expected, naturally, to find his pinnaces. But when,
elated at their success, his men came within sight of the
coast, their pinnaces were no longer there, and in their
places were seven Spanish pinnaces!</p>

<p>More hard luck! Here he was, with the first good
haul he had made, and yet unable to get away with
it. He told himself&mdash;and his men&mdash;that come what
might he was going to get to his frigates somehow.
Fortunately for the boaster, the Spanish pinnaces, unaware
of the presence of the raiders so near at hand,
weighed anchor and set out for Nombre de Dios. But
the question that faced Drake was how to get away?
No pinnaces! He solved the problem by building a
raft at once, rigging up a sail out of an old biscuit sack,
and calling for three volunteers to go with him to find
the pinnaces.</p>

<p>Everyone volunteered, but he took the three he
wanted, and then set out on his crazy craft. At times it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
threatened to capsize, at others it had them waist deep
in the water; and at all times while they sailed the
blazing sun poured down upon them. At last they
saw the pinnaces they had lost; but the men in the
boats did not see them, and they were too far off for a
hail to reach them. The pinnaces were lost sight of as
they rounded a headland, and Drake, taking the risk,
beached his raft and tore along the shore, in the hope
of finding the boats run up on the beach.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the four racing men turned the
headland they saw the pinnaces lying ashore, and, incidentally,
gave the sailors a scare, for they thought that
this sudden appearance betokened the failure and pursuit
of Drake. Drake, feeling it too good a joke to miss,
let them believe this for a time, and enjoyed the
crestfallen look on their faces. Then, with a shout,
he told them all, and away went the pinnaces to bring
back the treasure and the men left behind.</p>

<p>In a little while all were on board the ships, jubilant
at their success, though three Frenchmen were missing.
Drake sent a party ashore to search for these, and to
bring back the treasure that had been hidden. Only
one Frenchman was found, and none of the silver,
which, as we have seen, had been unearthed by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>Drake was angry at the loss, but taking comfort that
he had really managed to get a good haul, decided that
it was time to return to England. First of all he laid
in a stock of food by capturing a provision ship as
they sailed tauntingly by Carthagena. Then, with
hearty farewells to Pedro and his Cimaroons, whom
they allowed to take whatever they wanted out of the
ships, Drake and his merry men set sail for England,
where they arrived on Sunday, August 19th, 1573, and
were received with great joy by the people, who, forgetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
all about the preacher, rushed out of church to
welcome the coming of the man who by this time had
grown to be one of their idols.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, however, gave him a dubious welcome&mdash;that
is, publicly&mdash;for she was just then desirous
of being at peace with Spain; though it is by no means
certain that she was not as delighted as Drake at the
success of his voyage, which had gained him much
wealth and a fine reputation as a leader of men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A GALLANT FISHERMAN</h2>


<p class="ph1">A Brave Rescue in a Storm</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAPTAIN ALBERT GEMPTON, of Brixham,
ranks amongst those men who have helped to
make England the mistress of the seas, being a gallant
hero with a whole host of brave deeds to his credit.
A fisherman&mdash;a son of Devon, which has produced so
many hardy sons of the sea&mdash;probably one of the most
arduous pieces of work he ever undertook was when he
went to the rescue of two lads on a fishing smack off
Lundy Island on December 16, 1910. Incidentally, it
shows the kind of thing that very often befalls the fisherman,
who, going out to reap the harvests of the seas,
encounters untold dangers, while we at home go to our
breakfast tables, and all unthinking eat the fish to catch
which may have cost a man his life.</p>

<p>On this particular day there had been a severe storm,
which swept along the coast and caught many fishing
vessels at their work, a good number of them being
wrecked and all hands lost. The smack <i>Friendship</i> was
off Lundy Island when the storm broke out, and for a
time bravely battled against it; she held two men and
two apprentices, and these gallantly worked her, seeking
to get into port. But Fate was unkind; first the
skipper was taken bodily by the angry waves and carried
overboard, and was not seen again. Then, almost immediately
afterwards the other man suffered a like fate;
and the two apprentices, mere lads learning the trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
of the sea, found themselves alone on a smack they
knew not how to manage.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it was night; and for hours
the two boys struggled gamely with their vessel, fighting
the elements as best they knew how. The great
waves reared white-crested heads, swooped down upon
the smack, filling it with water; now she was on the
crest of a terrific wave, now in the trough, and the boys
thought that each moment would be their last. Their
one hope was to keep the water under, and for hours
and hours they worked hard at the pumps; but as fast
as they pumped the water out more swept in, and they
gave themselves up for lost. One, two, three o&#8217;clock
came and passed, and still they were fighting for life,
and with little hope of coming through. Then their
hearts gave a bound; they wiped the water from their
bleared eyes and looked across the waste of sea, scarcely
believing what they saw. A light!</p>

<p>Forgetting the necessity for working the pumps without
cessation, they rushed to the side and yelled themselves
hoarse, seeking to attract the attention of the
men on the boat they knew was there. Above the roar
of the storm their voices were soundless; they might
have yelled till Doomsday and never been heard. But
those men on the other vessel had seen&mdash;which was just
as good&mdash;and with sail set she rode before the wind,
drove her way through the water, and made for the
derelict. It was hard going, but Captain Gempton knew
that his little smack, the <i>Gratitude</i>, was a sturdy sailer;
and he realised that something was amiss.</p>

<p>After a stern struggle the <i>Gratitude</i> came near
enough to the <i>Friendship</i> to bawl out for information;
and the two boys yelled out the story of their plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save us!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;Save us! We&#8217;re alone,
and the water&#8217;s gaining on us!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Righto, sonnies!&#8221; cried Gempton. &#8220;Keep pumping.
We&#8217;ll have you off in a twinkling!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were brave words, but Gempton knew that a
&#8220;twinkling&#8221; was a comparative term. It would be no
light task to get alongside the <i>Friendship</i> without smashing
into her, bobbing up and down as she was to the
will of the waves. He man&#339;uvred his vessel carefully
to get her into the best position from which to try to
effect the rescue, knowing that it would be asking the
boys to jump to death to leap out and try to swim to
the <i>Gratitude</i>. If they were to be got off, they must be
fetched; and he knew it.</p>

<p>But try as he would, the <i>Gratitude</i> could not be got
within distance from which the boys could be saved.
There was only one way to do it; and that was to lower
a boat and row over to the smack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, boys!&#8221; said Gempton presently.
&#8220;Lower away!&#8221;</p>

<p>And his men hoisted the boat. Gempton, swathed
in his oilskins, took his seat in it; and at the same time
another man, John Tidmarsh, jumped in with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming too, skipper,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the captain; and the two men took
their seats, each of them carrying a lifebuoy. Then,
pushing off, they bent their backs to the oars, and
sought to pull the boat over the waves. What a tussle
that was! What a fight against the elements! The
wind caught them and hurled them forward; the waves
broke upon them and hurled them backwards. Huge
mountains of water fell upon them, swamping the boat,
almost filling it; and while one man rowed the other
bailed. Then on again&mdash;only to meet the same fate;
bail again, and then onward through the darkness and
the noise of Nature till eventually they came near to the
<i>Friendship</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Then was careful handling called for, lest the boat
be dashed into the side of the smack and broken to
pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy!&#8221; cried Gempton; and Tidmarsh grasped his
oars, plied them masterfully, and just as it seemed that
the boat was going to be smashed, she swung round
and missed the <i>Friendship</i> by the fraction of a yard.
And meanwhile the two boys were pumping for very
life, straining eyes through the darkness to catch a
glimpse of the heroes making for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never do it,&#8221; said one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;God grant they do!&#8221; said the other. &#8220;See&mdash;they&#8217;re
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, Gempton had brought his boat alongside,
where she lay rocking at the mercy of the waves,
but held in check by the firm hands on the oars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; bawled Gempton. &#8220;Quick, for your
lives!&#8221; And instantly the two boys forsook their
pumps and rushed to the side, ready to jump overboard
at the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221; &#8220;No!&#8221; The two words seemed to come
simultaneously. Gempton had given the first, Tidmarsh
the second, as the boat swung away from the smack.
Then, with a mighty tug at the oars the boat was
brought back again. &#8220;Jump!&#8221; And this time a boy
jumped, landing in the boat, and sending it pitching
and tossing, and threatening to overturn it. Again she
swung out, only to be pulled back; and once more a boy
jumped, and landed fairly in her.</p>

<p>They were saved! Not yet. The journey to the
<i>Gratitude</i> had still to be made, and now the wind was
against them, blowing down upon them in greater fury,
as though angry at being robbed of the prey it had
fought for all through the hours of the howling night.
It had seemed hours getting out to the <i>Friendship</i>; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
seemed years getting back. Time and time again the
water broke in upon them, and filled the boat so that
she could not easily ride the storm; the boys bailed like
madmen, and kept on bailing, and the two men held on
at their oars and rowed in the race against death.</p>

<p>They reached the <i>Gratitude</i>, where, with the waves
breaking upon them, and the wind battering at them,
the little company of four climbed perilously into the
ship&mdash;exhausted all of them, grateful two of them, and
well pleased the other two for having been able to effect
the rescue.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIRE AT SEA</h2>


<p class="ph1">Tragic Tales of Burning Ships</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is almost impossible to imagine anything more
appalling than a fire at sea. The floating home
of perhaps scores, maybe hundreds, of people blazing
away, iron and steel melting in the fierce heat, explosions
taking place here, there and everywhere; men
trapped in cabins and being roasted to death; heroic
sailors fighting the flames which there is no fire brigade
to fight for them&mdash;all these things go to make up a
scene of horror that beggars description.</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances on December 8, 1914,
when the oil-tank steamer <i>Vedra</i> took fire off Walney
Island. She had left Sabine, in Texas, some while
before, and run the gauntlet of the few German commerce
raiders in the Atlantic; and Captain Brewster
was telling himself, when he arrived off Barrow on
December 7, that his voyage was at an end, and that he
would soon be able to unload his cargo of benzine. He
counted his chickens before they were hatched, for
Dame Fortune was bent on playing him a scurvy trick.
For some time the weather had been rough, and the
<i>Vedra</i> had been forcing her way through in the teeth
of a gale which played shuttlecock with her. But the
sturdy steamer had fought hard and long to get to
her port; and now she was within sight. Across the
darkening waters signals were sent for a pilot to come
aboard and guide her into harbour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Meanwhile, the storm increased in fury, and the
<i>Vedra</i> found herself fighting against the titanic forces
of the deep. Now on the crest of a wave, now in the
trough the vessel lay, hovering at times, it seemed, on
the very edge of the pit of destruction, and at others
diving down, down, down, and then righting herself as
by a miracle.</p>

<p>The waiting men saw a tug put out and head towards
their ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pilot,&#8221; they muttered. &#8220;He&#8217;s in for a rough
trip!&#8221;</p>

<p>A rough trip it was, and one that was never finished,
for ere he could reach the <i>Vedra</i> the latter was taken
up, as it were, by giant hands and flung shorewards;
then swung about again and hurled towards Walney
Island. Firm as a rock Captain Brewster stood to his
post, and worked his ship like the mariner he was;
but it was a hopeless task, and very soon there was
a grinding that told she had run ashore. The engines
were immediately reversed, and the ship strained to
her utmost in the effort to get off the shore. As the
waters poured over her she seemed to shake herself like
a great dog. There was the hum of the engines below,
the swish of the propeller as it churned up the water,
but never a move backward did the <i>Vedra</i> make; rather,
she bumped more heavily and got farther in. She was
fast held.</p>

<p>Captain Brewster, realising now that it was useless
to try to float her by her own engines, signalled to the
shore for assistance, and the guardship <i>Furness</i>, lying
off the port, immediately put out and hurried to render
what aid she could, while at the same time the tugs
<i>Walney</i> and <i>Cartmel</i> pushed their noses through the
water in her direction. Captain Hill, of the <i>Furness</i>,
worked his vessel as near to the <i>Vedra</i> as was possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
with safety, and then, calling on the crew to stand by,
hurled a hawser towards her. Time and time again
the hawser was flung, only to fall short; but at last it
was successfully thrown, and caught by some of the
<i>Vedra&#8217;s</i> crew. It took but a little while for them to
hitch it securely; and when this was done the word
was given to the <i>Furness</i>, whose engines were reversed,
and away she bore till the hawser stretched taut from
ship to ship.</p>

<p>But the <i>Furness</i> found she had undertaken a task
that defied all her strength, and, strain though she did
with every ounce of steam in her and every horsepower
in her engines, she could not make the <i>Vedra</i>
budge from the fast hold in which she had been caught.
Suddenly, too, there was a crack that sounded above
the roar of the wind, and the <i>Furness</i> went staggering
back as a child staggers when someone lets go of a
rope he is straining at. The hawser had snapped in
two. A sharp command, and the <i>Furness</i> eased up,
and once more she steamed towards the <i>Vedra</i>; another
hawser was hurled, and again, eventually, was hitched
on. Then back she pulled, more carefully than ever
this time, with the hawser tightening between the two
vessels. Would it hold? Would the <i>Vedra</i> move?
Would the <i>Furness&#8217;s</i> engines stand the strain? Such
were the questions that raced through many a mind in
those anxious moments. On the <i>Vedra</i>, the captain
still at his post, men waited tensely, holding on to
anything at hand, lest they be pitched off into the
boiling sea below, while the whole ship seemed to
throb to the racing of her engines as they worked at
high pressure. But she refused to move.</p>

<p>Things were now assuming a very serious aspect,
though the coming of the two tug boats at this time,
under command of Commander Bisset, R.N., Harbour-master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
of Barrow, heartened the captain and crew, who
refused to heed exhortations thrown at them to leave
the vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; bawled the captain through his funnelled
hands. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not leave her till there&#8217;s no hope. I think
we can refloat her!&#8221;</p>

<p>So, as the men would stick to their duty, there was
nothing to do but to strive the utmost to get the ship
off, and the tugs and the guardship worked nobly with
this end in view; but all unavailingly. And while they
worked the news had been signalled along the coast,
and the lifeboats at Piel and Fleetwood put out to
succour the stranded mariners. Just as the Piel boat
reached the spot, however, a great calamity had come
to pass.</p>

<p>The buffeting of the wind and sea bumped the
<i>Vedra</i> heavily at every blow. The straining of her
engines had begun to tell; the engines soon gave up
the fight and refused to work any more; and the vessel
lay a helpless hulk, at the mercy of the elements&mdash;wind
and water, which were soon to be reinforced by a third&mdash;fire!
While the firemen below had been working
like niggers to keep their engines going, other men
had been busy at the pumps, pumping the oil out of
the tanks in order to lighten the ship and give her a
better chance of life. But pumped they never so
feverishly, never so lustily, they could not work fast
enough; they were fighting against Nature, which,
red in tooth and claw, delights to show man that,
despite his ingenuity, he is but puny.</p>

<p>Just as the engines gave up, the copper oil tank
gave way, and instantly the oil began to run out.
Now, it has always been a problem with oil-ships, this
bursting of the tanks when the vessel goes ashore&mdash;a
problem with a very serious point in it, and that is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the oil is then almost certain to run into the engine-room.
It did so in this case; while the men at the
pumps were sweating with their exertions, the oil was
running quickly towards the engine-room. There was
no stopping it, and very soon it reached the engines.
There was a burst of flame, followed by a terrific
explosion.</p>

<p>Horror-stricken, the men in the ships lying around
looked across the troubled waters at the now flaming
vessel. They knew only too well what had happened,
and how utterly helpless everything was; but they
steamed forward as closely as they dared, and in the
brilliant light could see men standing about the rails
of the vessel with agony-drawn faces and already
scorched clothes.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Vedra</i>? Down in the engine-room
there were only things that once were men; trapped
in that inferno, every man of them had been burned
to death. Some, standing on deck, had rushed, as
many as possible, to the weather side of the ship, where,
as the flames were blown away from them, they stood
a better chance of escape. Here they clung, maddened
with fear, waving a jersey to attract attention&mdash;as if
any attraction were needed! The light from the blazing
ship showed clearly and distinctly to the watchers the
whole tragic scene. Others, who were in the fo&#8217;c&#8217;sle,
were caught in a trap, and the would-be rescuers could
see them at the portholes, frantically calling for the help
that could not be given them.</p>

<p>All around the ship the sea was a blazing mass,
for the oil which had been pumped overboard had
caught fire. The two lifeboats sped through the sea
towards the flaming ship, but were driven back by the
intense heat. Ever and anon there were reports as of
great guns&mdash;with a roar the oil tanks exploded, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
added to the volume of flame which enveloped the
hapless ship and men. Then lesser reports; the steel
plates of the vessel were being blown out.</p>

<p>&#8220;No hope&mdash;no hope!&#8221; cried the entrapped men;
and then, driven mad by despair, determined to take all
risks. Some of them flung themselves overboard into
the flaming cauldron. They were never seen again.</p>

<p>Then there took place one of those deeds of heroism
which will never die while men have lips to tell of
courage and endurance. The chief engineer was
seen by those on the tugs to be standing on the poop
with three other men; hurriedly they saw him give his
comrades a lifebuoy each. They expected to see him
don one himself, but, looking again, realised that he had
not one left. In the brilliant light they could see him
urging his comrades to jump; could see them reluctant
to leave him; but, pressed by the brave man, at last
they leapt clear of the ship&mdash;into the sea of fire on which
were floating several lifebuoys and belts thrown out by
the tugs and lifeboats. They disappeared for a
moment, then came to the surface again, and could be
seen striking out towards the <i>Furness</i>, which, pushing
as near as was possible, went to their rescue. By the
greatest of good luck, after a fearful struggle for life
against sea and fire, two men, Second Engineer
McLoughlin and Fourth Engineer Dixon, were picked
up, sadly burnt, almost exhausted, but alive. The
third man was not so fortunate, and was not seen again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_150.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;The funnels and ventilators were belching forth mighty columns
of flame&mdash;every part of the ship was ablaze&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chief engineer had himself jumped
overboard, without any lifebuoy, and fought his way
yard by yard through the sea of flame till he came
within an arm&#8217;s length of the boat which had been put
off to rescue him. As though angry at being robbed
of the other men, the sea, seeming to gather in fury,
at that moment picked up the engineer on a tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
wave and hurled him back into the inferno, then back
against the death-ship, battering him to death.</p>

<p>It was evident now that there was no hope for any
other of the stricken crew. The funnels and ventilators
were belching forth mighty columns of flame&mdash;every
part of the ship was ablaze. Only one man was still
visible on deck, and he was so scared that he could do
nothing but cry agonisingly for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221; they yelled to him. &#8220;Jump!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t swim!&#8221; was the tragic answer; and, fearing
to trust himself to the treacherous sea, he remained
where he was, to become the victim of a still more
treacherous foe.</p>

<p>So ended the tragedy of the <i>Vedra</i>. Although the
tugs and lifeboats loitered about all night in the hope
of finding some survivor, they were unsuccessful.
Morning came. The ship was still burning furiously,
great columns of flame and smoke ascending to such
a height that they were visible at Fleetwood and Blackpool,
twenty miles away. Her plates were red hot;
all her tanks had long since exploded with terrific
reports; and when night fell she was nothing but a
shapeless skeleton, glowing in the sea, which itself was
like a burning oil well.</p>

<p>Out of a crew of thirty-six only two men were taken
off, and that despite all the gallant efforts that were
made. Even of these two only one lived, for a week
later one of them died in hospital from burns and shock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story of the burning of the <i>Earl of Eldon</i>, one
of the finest trading vessels then afloat (it was on
September 27, 1834, that the fire was discovered), is
an instance of the spontaneous combustion of a cargo
such as has often sent good ships to their doom. The
<i>Earl of Eldon</i> left Bombay on August 24, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
forty-five souls, including three ladies and a baby
amongst her passengers. She was laden with cotton
bales, screwed so tightly that when the time came to
move them, in order to try to save the ship, it was
found impossible to shift them sufficiently. Before the
cotton was put aboard it had been allowed to get
thoroughly wet through, but, knowing the danger of
wet cotton in a ship&#8217;s hold, the owners had had it dried
before shipment. Apparently the drying had not been
thorough, because the only explanation of the fire on
the <i>Earl of Eldon</i> is that, in just the same way that a
haystack takes fire from the firedamp that generates
inside it, so the cotton bales generated their own fire.
As stated above, the first signs of anything wrong were
discovered on September 27, when some of the passengers
noticed steam issuing from the fore-hatchway.
Captain Theaker, however, assured them that it was
only steam, which was a usual thing on cotton-loaded
ships. Presently, however, the smoke became so dense
that the passengers were really alarmed, and an officer
of the Madras Artillery, who was on board as a passenger,
was not at all surprised when Captain Theaker
knocked at his door and informed him that part of the
cotton was on fire, and that he wished all the gentlemen
passengers to come on deck for consultation. The rest
of the story cannot be better told than in the words of
the Indian officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being assembled,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the captain stated the
case to be that some part of the cargo appeared to have
spontaneously ignited, and he proposed removing the
bales until they should discover the ignited ones, and
have them thrown overboard, as also those which appeared
to be in the same damaged condition. He said
that there did not appear to be immediate danger, and
that he hoped we might be able to avert it altogether.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
However, at eight o&#8217;clock the smoke became much
thicker, and began to roll through the after-hatchway&mdash;the
draught having been admitted forward in order to
enable the men to work. Several bales were removed,
but the heat began to be intolerable below; the smoke
rolled out in suffocating volumes, and before nine
o&#8217;clock we discovered that part of the deck had caught
fire; in short, the men were obliged to knock off work.
The captain then ordered the hatches to be battened
down, with a view to keep the fire from bursting out,
and to hoist out all the boats and stock them in case
of necessity. This was done, and about half-past one
the three ladies, two sick passengers, an infant, and a
female servant were put into the longboat, with two
hundred and sixteen gallons of water, twenty gallons
of brandy, and biscuits for a month&#8217;s consumption,
together with such pots of jam and preserved meats as
we could get at, and the day&#8217;s provision of fresh and
salted meat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was now about two o&#8217;clock; the hatches were
then opened, and all hands set to work to endeavour
to extinguish the fire. The main hatch being lifted,
and a tarpaulin removed, there was a sail underneath
which was so hot that the men could hardly remove it;
when they did, the heat and smoke came up worse than
ever, and it being now known from inspection that the
fire was underneath that part, orders were given to hoist
out the bales until the inflamed ones could be got at;
but when the men laid hold of the lashings to introduce
a crane-hook, they were found to have been burned
through beneath, and came away in their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;The case now appeared bad, indeed. However,
we cut a bale open and tried to remove it by handfuls,
but the smoke and heat became so overpowering that
no man could stand over it, and water only seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
have the effect of increasing it, in the quantities we
dared to use, for had the captain ventured to pump
water into the ship to extinguish the fire, the bales
would have swelled so much as to burst open the deck,
and have increased so much in weight as to sink the
ship, so that either way destruction would have been
the issue. Under these circumstances, perceiving the
case to be utterly hopeless, the captain called us together
on the poop, and asked if anyone could propose any
expedient likely to avail in extinguishing the fire and
saving the ship, as in that case &#8216;we will stick by her
while a hope remains.&#8217; It was unanimously agreed that
all had been done that could be done; the men were
all perfectly sober, and had been indefatigable in their
exertions, but one and all seemed coolly and positively
of opinion that the case was hopeless. The heat was
increasing so much that it became dangerous to leave
the poop; the captain therefore requested us to get into
the boats, told off and embarked his men, and at three
o&#8217;clock he himself left the ship, the last man, just as
the flames were bursting through the quarter-deck. We
then put off, the two boats towing the longboat. The
ship&#8217;s way had been previously stopped by backing her
yards. She was now in one blaze, and her masts began
to fall in. The sight was grand, though awful. Between
eight and nine o&#8217;clock all her masts had fallen,
and she had burned to the water&#8217;s edge. Suddenly there
was a bright flash, followed by a dull, heavy explosion&mdash;her
powder had caught. For a few seconds her
splinters and flaming fragments were glittering in the
air, and then all was darkness, and the waters had closed
over the <i>Earl of Eldon</i>!</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_154.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;The ship was now in one blaze, and her masts began to fall in&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sad was the prospect now before us! There were
in the longboat the captain and twenty-five persons, including
an infant four months old; the size of the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
23 feet long by 7⅓ feet broad. In each of the others
ten individuals, including the officer in charge. One
of the boats had some bags of biscuit, but the chief
provision was in the longboat. We were, by rough
calculation, above 1,000 miles from Rodrigue, and 450
from Diego Garcias, the largest of the Chagos Islands;
but to get there we must have passed through the
squally latitudes we had just left, and been subject to
variable winds and heavy weather or calms, neither of
which we were prepared to resist. Seeing, then, that
our stock was sufficient, we determined on trying for
Rodrigue. About eleven o&#8217;clock we accomplished
rigging the boats and were under sail. We carried
a lantern lashed to our mast in the longboat to prevent
the other boats from losing us during the night; and
when day broke sent them sailing in all directions
around to look-out for ships. While the wind was light
they could outsail us, but when it became strong, and
the sea very high, the difference of speed was rather in
our favour, as the weight and size of the longboat
enabled her to lay hold of the water better.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the third day of our boat navigation, the change
of the moon approaching, the weather began to wear
a threatening aspect; but as we were in the Trade, we
did not apprehend foul or contrary winds. In the course
of the night it blew fresh, with rain. We were totally
without shelter, and the sea, dashing its spray over us,
drenched us, and spoiled a great part of our biscuit,
though we happily did not discover this until we were
nearly out of the want of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the course of the next day the weather grew
worse, and one of our small boats, in which was Mr.
Simpson, the second mate, with nine others, was split
by the sea. She came alongside, and we put the carpenter
into her, who made what repairs he could, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
with little hope of their answering. We then proceeded
to fasten a spray-cloth of canvas along our gunwale,
having lashed a bamboo four feet up the mast, and
fixed it on the intersection of two stanchions at the same
height above the stern. The spray-cloth was firmly
lashed along this, so as to form a kind of half-pent roof,
and had it not been for this imperfect defence we must
have been swamped; and we still shipped seas to so
great an extent that four men were obliged to be kept
constantly employed in bailing to keep her clear of water.
Towards evening it blew hard with a tremendous sea,
and, not thinking the other damaged boat safe, we took
in her crew and abandoned her. We were now thirty-six
persons, stowed as thick as we could hold, and obliged
to throw over all superfluities. We had not more than
eight inches of clear gunwale out of water!</p>

<p>&#8220;This night I shall never forget. Our situation was
indeed awful. Wet, crushed, and miserable, the night
passed away, and the day broke at last. A tremendous
sea came roaring down, and I held in my breath with
horror; it broke right over our stern, wetted the poor
women to their throats, and carried away the steersman&#8217;s
hat. The captain then cried out, in a tone calculated
to inspire with confidence he afterwards told me his
heart did not re-echo:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s nothing! It&#8217;s all right! Bail away, my
boys!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never expected us to live out that night; but,
harassed as he was in mind and body, he gallantly
stood up, and never by word or deed betrayed a feeling
that might tend to make us despair. He stood on the
bench that livelong night, nor did he ever attempt to
sleep for nearly forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning broke and passed away, and, after
the change of the moon, the weather began to moderate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and we enjoyed a comparative degree of comfort. We
had three small meals of biscuit and some jam, etc., and
three half-pints of water per day, with brandy, if we
liked it. The men had one gill of spirits allowed them
daily. We had plenty of cigars, and whenever we could
strike a light we had a smoke, and I never found tobacco
so great a luxury. The ladies were most wretched, yet
they never uttered a repining word.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the thirteenth evening we began to look out
for Rodrigue. The captain told us not to be too sanguine,
as his chronometer was not to be depended upon
after its late rough treatment. The night fell, and I
went forward to sleep, and about twelve was awoke by
the cry that land was right ahead. I looked and saw
a strong loom of land through the mist. The captain
had the boat brought to for an hour, then made sail
and ran towards it, and at half-past two it appeared still
more strongly. We then lay to until daylight. I attempted
to compose myself to sleep, but my feelings
were too strong, and after some useless attempts I sat
down and smoked with a sensation I had long been a
stranger to. With the first light of dawn, Rodrigue
appeared right ahead, distant about six miles, and by
eight o&#8217;clock we were all safely landed. A fisherman
who came off to show us the way through the reefs
received us in his house, and proceeded to feed us, and
in the meantime sent to tell the gentlemen of the island
of our arrival. Two of them came down immediately,
and, having heard our story, said that we had been
miraculously preserved. They then gave our bundles
to their negroes, and took us to their houses, where
everything they had was set before us&mdash;clean linen and
a plentiful dinner. They shook us down four or five
beds in an outhouse, and we enjoyed what we had not
known for the last fortnight&mdash;a sound sleep.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ROMANCE OF TREASURE-TROVE</h2>


<p class="ph1">These are True Stories of Treasure, and they are as Strange
as Fiction</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INTERWOVEN with the story of the sea there is
a vast amount of romance that wraps itself around
hidden treasure. Ever since the days when the pirates
roamed the seas at their own sweet will and took toll
of shipping, these tales of treasure have been told.
Dotted about here and there are small islands where
tradition has it that the pirates hid their hoards of
gold, silver, and precious jewels, intending to come
back for them at some future date; but, being caught
and hauled to justice, they died with their secret unrevealed,
and the treasure remained. Then someone
was told&mdash;or perhaps imagined&mdash;that such-and-such an
island held it, and expeditions would be fitted out to
seek for the treasure, which, as time rolled on, grew
in size and value till it assumed fabulous proportions.</p>

<p>Of course, there <i>are</i> hidden treasures secreted by
the old pirates, and there are, too, other hoards which
it would be well worth while to salvage, if the exact
places were known. One can go back as far as the
reigns of Tiberius and Caligula and find mention of
richly laden ships which foundered with all their treasure;
two galleys, for instance, containing plate, gold,
art treasures, and many jewels were lost in the Lake
Nemi, and nothing has ever been recovered, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the lake at this spot is only little more than a hundred
feet deep.</p>

<p>Coming to a much later date, the seventeenth century,
there is an authentic record of the recovery of a
vast quantity of lost treasure which was lost off
Hispaniola, when a great Spanish galleon went down
very many years before. A ship&#8217;s carpenter named
John Phipps by some means became aware of this
sunken treasure, and after some time prevailed upon
the Duke of Albemarle to fit out an expedition to
recover it. That expedition lasted a year, and folks
at home began to think that Phipps&#8217;s idea had been
all moonshine, and that nothing had come of it. Then
one day the one-time carpenter turned up with treasure
worth &pound;300,000. The story was romantic. Phipps
had been searching about the sea round Hispaniola,
for he had no sure idea as to exact locality, and perhaps
he himself had a suspicion that his information had
been incorrect, for he could find no trace of the wealth
he sought. Then one day, when off Port de la Plata,
looking over the side of the <i>Periaga</i>, a man &#8220;spied,&#8221;
says the account written by a New England historian,
&#8220;a feather growing, as he judged, out of a rock, whereupon
one of their Indians (whom they had brought for
the purpose) dived in, and, bringing up the feather,
brought them withal a surprising story that he perceived
a number of great guns in the watery world
where he had found his feather, the report of which
great guns exceedingly astonished the whole company,
and at once turned their despondencies for their ill-success
into assurances that they had now lit upon the
true spot of ground which they had been looking for;
and they were further confirmed in their assurances
when, upon further diving, the Indian fetched up a
&#8216;Sow,&#8217; as they styled it, or lump of silver, worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
perhaps two or three hundred pounds. This news was
communicated to Phipps. &#8216;Then,&#8217; said he, &#8216;thanks
be to God, we are made&#8217;; and so away they went, all
hands to work.... Now, most happily, they fell upon
that room in the wreck where the bullion had been
stored up, and they so prospered in this &#8216;new fishing&#8217;
that in a little while they had, without the loss of any
man&#8217;s life, brought up <i>thirty-two tons of silver</i>! For it
was now come to measuring silver by tons. Thus did
there once again come into the light of the sun a
treasure which had been half a hundred years groaning
under the water. Besides that incredible treasure
in plate of various forms thus fetched up from seven or
eight fathoms under water, there were vast riches of
gold and pearls and jewels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carpenter Phipps received a boisterous welcome in
England when he returned, and was knighted, and in
due course became Governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Sometimes seekers after treasure go forth on their
quest and are never heard of again. In 1888, for instance,
there left the Thames a little steamer called
the <i>Seabird</i>, which was destined, so it was said, for
coastal work in South America. Some three months
later she was seen off Descada, and from that time to
this has not been heard of. Plainly one of those
mysteries of the sea referred to in another chapter;
but a mystery with something behind it. The accepted
explanation is that the owners had gone to seek treasure-trove
buried by La Fitte, a French pirate, in the
early days of the nineteenth century, on one of the
Leeward Islands, either Marie Galanti or Descada,
where the <i>Seabird</i> was sighted. There might be little in
that to connect the <i>Seabird</i> with treasure-hunting, were
it not for the fact that when she left the Thames she
had two divers aboard, who were ranked on the books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
as steward and cook&#8217;s mate. Twelve months after
the <i>Seabird</i> disappeared the mother of Rider, the
&#8220;steward,&#8221; heard from her son, who sent her a draft
on a San Francisco bank for &pound;100, and a letter saying
that she would hear from him again, and that he and
the &#8220;cook&#8217;s mate,&#8221; Cadman, had been &#8220;lucky.&#8221; He
was as silent as the grave as to the fate of the <i>Seabird</i>;
and neither he nor any of the crew has been heard of
since.</p>

<p>If the pirates were alive, and would only speak! If
Blackbeard, that picturesque scourge of the sea, could
but reveal the place where he hid his treasure, unseen
even by his own men, what a rush there would be!
What a hoard might be found! Though not perhaps
so large a one as the tales that are told lead one to
suppose. Poor old Captain Kidd&#8217;s hidden wealth, for
instance, started with &pound;300&mdash;according to a man who
sailed with him&mdash;and after the captain was hanged it
grew and grew and grew until it was so large that not
one, nor two, but dozens of places were necessary to
hold it! So do myths arise from the flimsiest of facts.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century, when English ships
scoured the seas to wring wealth from Spain, many a
Spanish ship was sunk, with all her treasure, rather
than it should fall into the hands of the &#8220;English
devils&#8221;; and when the Invincible Armada was put to
flight, and, storm-tossed, sought to reach home by
sailing round the north coast of Scotland and the west
coast of Ireland, numbers of the vessels were wrecked;
and, as they contained huge treasures, fortunes might
be gained by properly organised search parties with the
latest dredging and diving apparatus.</p>

<p>Sometimes the romance of treasure-trove is over-clouded
by tragedy; and very often for nothing. The
story is told of the foundering of the American ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
<i>Reliance</i>, Captain Harding and his crew of twelve men
barely escaping with their lives in the boats. Then
a storm broke upon them and separated the boats, and
Hiram Manly, mate, and nine men found themselves
alone on the watery waste, being buffeted about, in
danger every minute of being swamped. They worked
desperately to keep her afloat, happy to be so far safe.
Then one man was washed overboard by a huge
wave, another fell dead from his exertions, and the
survivors, day after day under pitiless sun, and night
after night, held on their way, economising the
few provisions and little water they had, becoming
delirious as the anxiety told on them. Two more
men were lost one night&mdash;perhaps the madness seized
them, and they flung themselves overboard to end it
all; perhaps a wave took them. But, whatever it was,
they disappeared without a sound. The survivors, after
what seemed an eternity of suffering, were at last flung
upon a coral island, where they found water, which,
because of the uncontrolled thirst upon them, killed two
of them. Then fish was found; Hiram built a fire from
drift wood, lighted it by the crystal glass of a watch
and the sun&#8217;s rays, and then went to rouse his sleeping
comrades. One man was dead.</p>

<p>Then the three castaways fell to eating their first
good meal for many a day, and afterwards set out to
explore the island, Manly going in one direction and
the other two&mdash;Dillon and Harper&mdash;in another. They
found no sign of human beings, and presently Dillon
and Manly met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Harper?&#8221; asked Manly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never see him again,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;He&#8217;s
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; cried Manly. &#8220;Where did it happen,
and how?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;Sharks!&#8221; said Dillon. &#8220;He went to bathe, and&mdash;and
they got him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the body come ashore?&#8221; Manly asked, filled
with horror, and wondering when his own turn would
come. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed Dillon. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use. We
should never find him!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Manly persisted, and ran off in the direction
from which Dillon had come; and in half an hour came
upon the body of Harper, with a knife wound in his
chest!</p>

<p>Instantly Manly&#8217;s thought flew to the agitation of
Dillon when he suggested seeking the body, and he
knew that there had been treachery. But why? Why
should Dillon kill Harper, a man with nothing of value
on him? Not even his clothes were worth having, torn
and ragged as they were.</p>

<p>Manly raised himself from beside the dead man,
turned, and, turning, saw Dillon creeping towards him
with an open knife in his hand. Weaponless, Manly
for a moment was filled with terror; then, catching up
a handful of sand, he flung it into the murderer&#8217;s eyes,
blinding him for the minute. Then, with a bound,
Manly was upon him, clutching him by the throat and
wrestling for the knife. For a long time the two men
fought, biting, scratching, Dillon seeking to use his
knife, Manly trying to seize it; but at last, with a sharp
twist, Manly sent the murderer headlong to the ground,
and the next instant was upon him, and, joy! he had
the knife.</p>

<p>Again they fought.... And Dillon met the fate
of the man he had killed.</p>

<p>Panting from his exertions, Manly sat on the sand
beside the dead man, and his bleared eyes looked out
to sea. He leapt to his feet, weariness all gone, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
thought of the tragedy forgotten; he waved his hands
frenziedly, yelled hysterically:</p>

<p>&#8220;A sail! A sail!&#8221;</p>

<p>Away out there was a ship.</p>

<p>Tearing his shirt from his back, Manly rushed to
the water&#8217;s edge and waved it long and feverishly,
waved it till there came from the ship the boom of
a gun, that told him he had been seen. And then
reaction set in; he dropped senseless to the earth.</p>

<p>They found him thus; found Dillon, too, lying
dead, and knew that some tragedy had been enacted
on the silent, lonely strand. When Manly came round
he blurted out his story, telling all.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should he have killed Harper?&#8221; said
the officer who had come ashore with the boat party.</p>

<p>&#8220;It fails me,&#8221; said Manly.</p>

<p>The next moment the pair were startled as a seaman
rushed towards them with a cry upon his lips. He
placed something in the officer&#8217;s hand. They were two
small golden coins.</p>

<p>They were coins such as Manly knew none of his
comrades had possessed, and there was a gleam in
his eyes as he looked at the officer, neither speaking
a word.</p>

<p>Quietly they walked over to Dillon, searched him,
and found three more coins of the same kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon that was the motive, sir,&#8221; said Manly.
&#8220;They found these while they were exploring the
island, and Dillon, thinking he had come across
treasure-trove, decided to kill us both off. Harper went
first, and my turn would have come very soon. Thank
God I went in search of Harper!&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer agreed with Manly in his suggestion,
and soon had his men searching the beach; but not
another coin was discovered. Instead, they found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
skeleton of a man&mdash;of some poor mariner, no doubt,
who had been cast ashore, his worldly possessions
consisting of the five gold coins that had roused the
cupidity of Dillon, and had brought tragedy upon
them.</p>

<p>Presently Manly was taken on board the <i>Bristol</i>,
and sailed away from the coral island, the scene of a
tragedy of treasure that never existed.</p>

<p>Everyone has heard of the treasure of Cocos Islands,
off Panama, to which many expeditions have been sent,
though without success. The treasure was hidden by
a pirate named Beneto Bonito, and hidden so securely
that, although many expeditions&mdash;some of them recent
ones&mdash;have been sent out to find it, none has yet succeeded.
But, despite failure, year after year men go
forth, secretly and well equipped, seeking the hoards of
riches that they fondly believe they will some day find.</p>

<p>Perhaps they will.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURES UNDER SEA</h2>


<p class="ph1">Strange Happenings to Submarines and Divers</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAN, not content with fighting Father Neptune for
mastery on the seas, has gone farther than that,
and has sought to show that he is not afraid of any
terrors beneath the seas: he would be master over all.
So men have become divers; so ships which can sink
and rise again have been made. And the diver and the
submarine boat have added to the tale of man&#8217;s conquest
over Nature; their chapter is as full of vigour and vim
and adventure as any chapter in the tale.</p>

<p>We are not concerned with the make-up of the submarine,
but with the adventures of the brave and hardy
sailors who man them, and the part the boats play in
great naval wars. The latter may be dismissed by saying
that the submarine&#8217;s work is to dash forth from the
security of harbours, and make sudden attacks upon the
bigger craft of the enemy in the hope of reducing their
number. These were the tactics employed by Germany
in the great war of 1914-15. Aware that Britain&#8217;s
navy was vastly superior to her own, and that the only
hope for success in a great encounter would be when
the British navy had been reduced, Germany kept her
Dreadnoughts and other big craft safe in her harbours,
contenting herself with sending out submarines to
strike sudden blows at the British patrolling vessels
guarding the seas. Britain employed her submarines
for the purpose of luring the Germans from their harbours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
(as the account, given in another chapter, of the
Battle of the Bight of Heligoland shows).</p>

<p>While British and German submarines were playing
the risky game of scouring the seas, French
submarines were not idle; and in the latter days of
December, 1914, there was told the story of an adventure
as thrilling as ever fictionist wove for the delight of
his readers.</p>

<p>The number of the submarine was not given; neither
was the name of the place where the incident took place.
All that was told was that on a certain Saturday morning
the submarine left port, and at three o&#8217;clock on the
following morning had reached its objective&mdash;namely,
an enemy port. Two miles out the boat dived, and
going at the rate of about three miles an hour, made for
the entrance of the port where the Frenchmen hoped to
find some battleships which would provide good targets
for their torpedoes. In due course they reached the
entrance; it was guarded by a boom, on the other side
of which were several battleships and destroyers.</p>

<p>Chagrined at the fact that the boom prevented them
from firing at the warships, the French sailors hung
about awhile in the hope that the enemy would perhaps
issue forth. Meanwhile, the officer kept his eye upon
the mirror, which through the periscope showed him
what was going on, and which, incidentally, was a
source of danger to the submarine; for the eye of the
submarine, sticking up about eighteen inches above the
surface, is easily seen in good light by the look-out of a
battleship; and in time of war a very sharp watch is
kept for these bobbing &#8220;eyes,&#8221; which betoken the presence
of death-dealing boats. The Frenchmen knew
their danger, but they had come out to do something,
and refused to give up until they found it impossible to
carry out their mission.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>So they stayed there&mdash;waiting for something to
happen.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<p>The man at the mirror saw the battleships and destroyers
moving, and, giving the order to stand by, he
waited until they passed within a short distance of the
submarine. They were anxious moments for every man
in her; they knew that at any minute some watcher on
the enemy&#8217;s decks might detect them and heavy shells
come hurtling towards them, perhaps to snap the periscope
and turn the cigar-shaped craft into a blind,
helpless thing, when, if she kept below, she might run
foul of a ship&#8217;s bottom, and if she rose to the surface
be at the mercy of the waiting foes. Into such moments
is crowded the spice of war, and these gallant Frenchmen
were quite prepared for it.</p>

<p>Luckily the foes passed by without noticing the lurking
boat, and the officer, anxious to get within a distance
which would enable him to take a more accurate
aim, gave orders for the submarine to draw nearer to
them. Stealthily she approached, every man in her at
tension and at his post, ready for the time to come when
they could launch their death-tube.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boat seemed to shiver, then to strain
as a dog strains at the leash, then to shiver again; and
there was a grinding noise. Then the boat came to a
standstill, though her engines were still going.</p>

<p>Instantly the men sprang into action, seeking the
cause of this unfortunate event. What had happened?
they asked themselves. They soon knew. Investigation
showed them that steel cables had caught the rudder
of their boat and held her prisoner. Apparently this
was a method adopted by the enemy to trap them, for
the cables drew them upwards&mdash;ever upwards, till they
were close to the surface, and at the same time torpedoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
came swishing through the water towards them. Time
after time these death-tubes sped at them, to miss them
by merest fractions of inches, it seemed. Simultaneously
shells fell thick and fast around them, sending
the water up in great spouts. It was literally an inferno,
from which the Frenchmen realised that there was
little chance of escape. But what chance there was
they took.</p>

<p>Boxed up in their little citadel they waited for death&mdash;waited
for the crash that would tell them a shell had
found its target; waited for the explosion which would
end the suspense and bring the death that was so slow
in coming. This waiting in helplessness was far worse
than taking the chances of death in an encounter with
the foe when they were free to fight manfully against
them.</p>

<p>But though they knew that death was so near to
them, and though escape seemed impossible, yet they
bent their every effort in an attempt to free the boat from
the grip of the cables. They filled the water tanks to
their utmost capacity, and every man joined in pressing
on the steering wheel; the perspiration of energy and
anxiety stood upon their brows as they worked; the
atmosphere was electric; they knew that the next few
minutes must decide their fate. How they worked!
What prayers for life they prayed, these men of death!</p>

<p>Suddenly the grim silence of the interior was broken
by the cries of the men&mdash;cries of joy. With her engines
at full speed, the little craft had fought and strained
against the impeding leash, had fought victoriously, for
with a jerk the cables broke away and the submarine
bounded forward; the men at the wheel felt it answer
to their pressure, and down the boat went at full speed
to a depth of sixteen metres.</p>

<p>They were saved!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Ecstatic in their joy at deliverance the Frenchmen
embraced each other, and for a moment forgot that above
them rode the giant foes who, unaware yet that they had
escaped from the cables, were no doubt still potting away
at the spot, and still sending their torpedoes in that
direction. But very soon the sailors came back to the
world of action, and realised that they were still far
from safe; they must hurry away immediately if they
would escape. There was little chance of doing any
damage to the foe, who were now on the <i>qui vive</i>; and
only one course was open to the French, and that was
to get away. They dared not rise to the surface, and
they had to chance their luck and keep below. For
two hours&mdash;hours full of anxiety&mdash;they went along under
water, well aware that they were pursued by the foes,
whose guns continually spoke as the periscope was fired
at. Knot after knot was eaten up, and still the pursuers
kept on after them; but at last they were shaken off,
and the men in the submarine knew that they were
indeed safe.</p>

<p>But, cautious even now, they still remained beneath
the surface till the shades of evening fell; and then, and
then only, did they dare to rise, after having been
submerged for nothing short of twelve hours! Twelve
hours as full of peril and thrill as any hours man ever
spent!</p>

<p>They were not even then out of the wood; for shortly
afterwards they sighted another of the enemy&#8217;s ships,
and again they had to dive and go on their way beneath
the water; but eventually they reached their port safely,
happy to have escaped, but chagrined at not having been
able to do any damage to the foe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Because</span> we do not reap the benefits in daily life
of the work of the diver, few of us give him much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
thought; but for a hazardous, heroic vocation, that of
the man in the diving suit is probably without equal.</p>

<p>A thousand little things may happen, and each one
of them be sufficient to cut the slender thread of life for
the diver; a man in the boat above, for instance, may
make a slight mistake, and&mdash;but there is no need to
moralise. Take the case of John Edward Pearce, a
diver, who one day in 1868 was hard at work in eighty
feet of water, where the sunken barque <i>Mindora</i> lay
off Dover. You couldn&#8217;t have seen the diver, of course,
but the cutter riding to the swell, and the man aboard
her holding the lifeline, would have told you plainly
enough that below the water was a man working
amidst the remains of what was once a proud little
ship.</p>

<p>That man with the line was in touch with the man
below; he held the thread of life and death. Suddenly
he received a signal from below, and called out to another
man, a diver:</p>

<p>&#8220;Slack away the wreck rope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye!&#8221; cried the man. And it was done.
Then the two men waited, expecting to see the diver&#8217;s
helmet appear above the surface, and ready to haul him
aboard.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of Pearce; only something
was happening down there, for the man with the lifeline
could tell by the pull.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he up to?&#8221; the diver asked, for he knew
that it was unusual for a diver to give the signal to
come up and then to remain below.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;but he seems to
have gone back into the hold again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon you&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; said the diver. &#8220;The line&#8217;s
too deep for him to be in the hold. Something&#8217;s gone
wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>They signalled down to Pearce again and again,
but getting no answer began to haul away at the hoisting
tackle.</p>

<p>After an anxious time of straining at the ropes, they
succeeded in bringing the diver to the surface, hauled
him into the cutter, unscrewed his helmet and&mdash;thought
him dead. Applying artificial respiration immediately in
the hope of his being alive, and forcing brandy between
the clenched teeth, they were fortunate enough to bring
Pearce round; and then the mystery was explained.
The signal man had made a mistake; he had called
&#8220;Slack away!&#8221; when he should not have done, with the
result that the diver had slipped from the deck of the
sunken <i>Mindora</i>, to fall heavily on the floor of the
ocean, cutting his air supply and knocking himself unconscious.
A few moments more down there, with the
air supply cut off, and he would inevitably have died of
suffocation.</p>

<p>This was by no means the only adventure that befel
Pearce in the course of his work in the depths, and
although the following incident took place in a river,
and not at sea, it may be included in this record. He
was at work on the s.s. <i>London</i>, which had sunk in the
Tay, and his task was to attach the bales of cotton with
which she was laden to the large drag hooks which men
in the vessel above were letting down to him. What
made the job a ticklish one was the fact that the water
was thick, and, as he himself said, &#8220;I had to do all my
work by feeling!&#8221;</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine that Pearce found it very hard
to manipulate the drag hook which, after hauling a bale
up, would descend to him again, perhaps narrowly missing
knocking him on the helmet, to the danger of the
glass front, which, breaking, would mean death. However,
this did not happen; instead, after he had fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
the four-pronged hook in a bale it slipped, and in doing
so, and before Pearce could jump aside, caught him in
the palm of his hand. The winches above, of course,
were hauling away at the chain which, going up, carried
Pearce with it, and soon he found himself in intense
agony on the upper deck of the <i>London</i>. By good luck
he managed to wrench the hook out of his palm just
then, and the chain went upwards without a load, and
the men above believed that the bale had slipped as it
was being hoisted. They little knew what kind of a
load it had had on it&mdash;a human load! Once free of the
hook Pearce, suffering severely, and feeling faint from
loss of blood, gave the signal to be hauled up, and in
a short time was on the surface. The men in the lighter
quickly attended to him, and they found that his palm
had been torn completely open, and that the hook had
penetrated the third finger. That accident cost Pearce
three months&#8217; work, and for a long time he despaired
of ever being able to use the hand again.</p>

<p>Jim Hartley, diver, had an adventure of another kind
under the sea. A vessel had sunk off Honolulu,
and Hartley, who was stranded at the island after
roving around a bit, undertook to explore the wreck if
a diving suit could be found. The island was ransacked
and a suit found, whereupon Hartley donned it,
and rowed out in a small sloop with one man to help
him. The people on the shore had told him to beware
of sharks, and Hartley took with him a large knife&mdash;and
it was a good job he did! The first time he went
down he couldn&#8217;t do much good, because he landed
amongst a lot of sharp rocks which threatened to cut his
airpipe; so he went up again, and ventured down on
the next good tide. This time he lighted on the sunken
ship, which had a big hole in her port bow. Thinking
he would inspect the other side Hartley started to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
round, when there was a swirl of water, a sudden darkening,
and a jerk at the signal line and air pipe.</p>

<p>Instinctively Hartley knew that a big fish had fouled
him, and thoughts of sharks entered his mind. Looking
up through the now cloudy water, he saw a huge
shark. Presence of mind is the great thing for a diver
to possess, and Hartley had it. Quick as lightning he
dropped on to his back and lay there, waiting for the
shark to come, knowing that in that position he had a
better chance if it came to a fight than he would have
if he stood upright. His great fear was that the shark
might cut the air-hose, and that if the man in the
sloop caught sight of the shark he might begin to haul
up. In that case, the diver knew that he would be at
the mercy of the great fish, which would swoop down
upon him as he was going up, and while he had no
leverage for his feet.</p>

<p>Fortunately the man in the sloop did not see the
shark, and Hartley, lying there on his back, with his
large knife held in his right hand, waited&mdash;anxiously,
watchfully&mdash;wondering what the shark would do. As
though playing with its prey the huge fish swam back
a few yards, then forward again, and this time it was
lower down, and so nearer to the supine man, who expected
that every minute the shark would swoop down
upon him. But no; back it went again, only to swim
forward once more until it was three feet above him.</p>

<p>This was Hartley&#8217;s opportunity; he knew that if the
shark hauled off again, the next time it would come
right on to him, and then&mdash;&mdash;Hartley took opportunity
by the forelock; he rose from his back, and, with a
terrific lunge, thrust his knife at the shark. Instantly
the water was dyed red, the great tail lashed the water
angrily and caught Hartley a terrific thwack, which
sent him headlong to the ground again. The water was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
now so thick that it was impossible to see anything, and
life depended on being able to find the signal line.
Groping about in the dark, by great good luck the diver
caught the rope, gave it a sharp tug that told the man
above to haul away, and up went Hartley, nervous until
he reached the surface lest the blow he had given the
shark had not been sufficient to give it its quietus.
However, all was well, and in due course the diver was
able to go down again and complete his work.</p>

<p>A more terrifying fight with a shark was that which
a diver once had in a diving bell. In this case the diver
sat on a small seat suspended in the bell, which slowly
descended into the water. To the horror of the
diver, when the bell rested on the bottom forty feet
down, he discovered that he had a companion&mdash;a shark!
The great fish darted hither and thither about the bell,
and a whisk of its tail knocked the diver off his seat.
Quick as lightning the man scrambled to his place again
and sat there, a hopeless prisoner, with the tiger of the
seas almost brushing against him as it swooped around
the bell, seeking to find a way out of the prison. It
grew angrier and angrier every moment, and the diver
knew that it would soon turn upon him unless he could
manage to kill it at once. Round and round the bell
went the maddened fish; silent, anxious, the diver waited
for his chance; and as the shark drew near to him, he
made a sudden grab at its dorsal fin with one hand,
and with the other drove a sharp tool into the gleaming
side.</p>

<p>It was but the beginning of things. The blow
seemed to make the shark more angry than ever; and
the blood-red water was lashed to a fury as the fish
turned and swept down upon the man, seeking to catch
him in its capacious maw. How he held on to his
seat the diver never knew, but he did so; and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
time the shark dashed near him he stabbed at it viciously
with the tool. It was, indeed, a duel to the death,
this fight between the stabbing man and the flashing
fish. The diver, who had given the signal to be hoisted
up, prayed that the men above would not take long, for
he was becoming weary of the struggle. His arms were
aching, his head was swimming, and, despite all his
pluck, there was the haunting dread that the giant fish
might be victorious. Luckily for the man the shark
was also weakened, though even in its death agonies it
made attacks upon the diver, who was presently gladdened
at the sight of daylight and the ship. Quickly
the crew had the bell aboard, and before their eyes was
a strange sight: a dying shark, in death-travail, lashing
its tail on the deck, and a man, faint, weary, nauseated,
who dropped beside the victim.</p>

<p>Here is another picture of a man&#8217;s adventure among
sharks. A cattle ship had been wrecked. A diver went
below to overhaul it, and found that a school of sharks
had got there before him, attracted by the smell of the
feast they nosed about after. Laying a charge and blowing
off the hatches, the diver saw the carcasses of the
cattle rise from the hold, to be attacked immediately by
the hungry sharks which swarmed about him. There
were two alternatives open to him: either to remain
below and risk having his airpipe severed, or to go up
and risk being attacked as he went. He chose the latter
as being the lesser of two evils. So the signal was
given; the men above began to haul him up. As he
went he had to pass through the school of voracious fish,
some of which turned their attention away from the dead
cattle to the living man. Swinging from this side to
that as he was attacked, the diver managed to ward off
the tigers of the deep, and, by a very miracle, reached
the surface with no more hurt than an injured hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHASING PIRATES IN THE CHINA SEA</h2>


<p class="ph1">Tales of Modern Pirate Hunting</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT must not be supposed that all pirates lived in the
far distant past, or that there are no pirates nowadays.
It is true that the picturesque gentlemen whose
acquaintance we have made so far have disappeared from
the high seas, but fellow rogues of theirs still ply their
trade far away in the East. The coasts of China have
always been infested by pirates; of course, they are not
so numerous or so open in their methods to-day as they
were, say, forty or fifty years ago, for China has awakened
from her lethargy of ages, and her ancient civilisation
is being supplanted by a newer one which will not
tolerate pirates. As a matter of fact, the old Chinese
civilisation did not tolerate them; but the officials were
so slack, and so cowardly, that the freebooters laughed
at them and their efforts to suppress piracy. It was
for this reason that Great Britain had gunboats in the
Far Eastern waters whose mission it was to destroy
the pirates&mdash;rout them out of their strongholds, and
sink or capture their junks.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Tonquin, the island of Hainan, and the
length of coast from that point to Macao, were&mdash;and are&mdash;what
might be termed the hunting-ground of the
Chinese pirates. Macao, as a glance at the map will
show, is on the opposite side of the Canton River to
Hong-Kong, the British naval base. The trading was
done chiefly from Hong-Kong to the northward, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
country below Macao being practically unknown to
Europeans. The British steamer <i>Takon</i> was held up
on April 27th, 1914, by pirates off Kian, to the north of
Macao. It was late at night, and the captain was on
his bridge. The pirates swarmed along the deck, killing
as they went, and instantly all was confusion. There
were two hundred and thirty people on board, including
passengers and crew, and it was a bold attempt the
pirates made. The officers and crew opposed them
nobly, and tried to force them back; but nothing could
stop them. Across the deck they went towards the
bridge where the captain stood, revolver in hand, blazing
away at them as fast as he could. Here so good a
stand was made, that the pirates found they would be
unable to win, and, while some kept the captain and
his few men engaged, others rushed below and set fire
to the ship. Very soon the vessel was a blazing mass,
with women and children screaming, pirates jumping
overboard to escape capture, the crew launching boats
and trying to get the women and children off.</p>

<p>Naturally, after the turmoil of the fight, there was
much confusion, for people had lost their heads, and
though incoming steamers rescued over a hundred and
fifty from the ship, which was burnt to the water&#8217;s edge,
when the toll was taken next morning it was found that
a hundred and eighty were missing, including the chief
officer, Evans, who had been last seen clinging to a
floating oar. Of the rescued, some showed signs of the
encounter with the pirates, several of whom had been
killed and a number of others wounded.</p>

<p>To go farther back, in 1865, a large junk, with a fine
cargo of opium, left the port bound for Swatow in the
north. Now, as the junk was well armed and well
manned, having no fewer than a dozen 12- to 18-pounder
guns and some forty-five men on board, it seemed unlikely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
that she would be molested by the pirates. For
this reason a number of people sailed in her, thinking
themselves safe. The better not to be noticed by any
prowling piratical craft, the junk slipped out of harbour
at evening, but, the wind falling, she had to anchor
about nine o&#8217;clock a few miles from the outer roads of
Hong-Kong, the crew, despite their strength, and the
passengers, despite the crew, feeling anything but at
ease in their minds; at any moment they knew they
might be swooped down upon by a number of pirate
junks, and then&mdash;well, here is the &#8220;then.&#8221;</p>

<p>At midnight, while the passengers were tossing
about uneasily, a dark shape loomed out of the night,
there was a grating of ship&#8217;s side against ship&#8217;s side,
the patter of running feet on deck, and before the crew
or the passengers could gather themselves together&mdash;before
they even knew what was afoot&mdash;they were
clapped under the hatches, prisoners to pirates. Eighty-three
people had been captured by, perhaps, half that
number!</p>

<p>Once having secured their prisoners, the pirates set
the junk&#8217;s sails, and under cover of the darkness took
her back towards Hong-Kong, keeping well away from
the coast until they were on the south side of the island.
Here, at daybreak, they ordered the prisoners to come
up on deck one by one.</p>

<p>They came; and as each one showed head above the
hatch, he or she&mdash;for there were women and children
aboard&mdash;was seized by the pirates, bound hand and
foot, and pitched headlong into the sea; these ruffians
didn&#8217;t trouble about planks! A man stood too much
chance of being saved if he walked off a plank, and
very little if flung overboard with his feet and hands
tied.</p>

<p>Eighty-two of the batch were treated in this way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the sole exception being a child of twelve years of age,
whom they decided to keep and turn into ship&#8217;s boy.
Then away went the pirates to a snug little harbour
near Macao, where they shared their spoil&mdash;no little lot,
either, for the ship had been well laden. Then the
captured junk was burnt, and the pirates broke up into
little companies and went anywhere they felt inclined,
to spend their ill-gotten gains, and then to return to
their trade.</p>

<p>Seven of the rogues, taking the little boy with them,
boarded a steamer bound for Hong-Kong. The pirates,
used to such ventures, maintained a fine pose, but the
poor little laddie, scared out of his wits and wondering
what was likely to happen to him, attracted the attention
of the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the captain. And,
with nervous glances about him, lest a pirate should
catch him confiding to the kind-hearted man, the boy
told him the story of the tragic night on the junk.
Telling him to say nothing to anyone else, the captain,
when the steamer arrived at Hong-Kong, stopped in
the middle of the river, and hailed the police-boat.
This arriving, the whole batch of passengers, numbering
over a hundred, was lined up, and the boy made
to pick out the seven pirates, who were taken prisoners
and sent to the lock-up.</p>

<p>The people of Hong-Kong were in a fine stew over
the matter already, for the previous evening one of the
men who had been flung overboard had, by a miracle,
succeeded in getting his hands and feet free, and, being
a good swimmer, made his way to a small island near
at hand, whence he took a fishing-boat to Hong-Kong
and told his story. But though the authorities made
inquiries none of the pirates were captured, except the
seven mentioned, who were duly tried and hanged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>The terror which the pirates struck into the inhabitants
of the small coast towns&mdash;and large ones, too&mdash;is clearly
shown in the following story, told by Captain St. John,
R.N., who commanded one of the gunboats detailed to
tackle the rovers. He was cruising about the coast in
1865, shortly after the incident above-mentioned, when
a sampan hailed him, and the fisherman in it cried
excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have got pilong!&#8221; (pirate).</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he was asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can makee see,&#8221; was the answer. And he pointed
to a couple of junks which were making out to sea.
That was enough for St. John. After them he went,
and the junks had no chance against the steam gunboat,
which rapidly overhauled them. Before the British
vessel could get alongside, however, a number of other
junks swung out from the shore, and there began a
miniature battle&mdash;much noise, much smoke, though
probably not much damage on the part of the official
junks, anyhow; for it was left to Captain St. John
to effect the capture of the pirate junks. Anchoring
off shore with his prisoners, the captain interviewed
the mandarin who came aboard. In true Oriental
fashion the latter thanked the Britisher for what he had
done, considering it a vast achievement to have captured
a couple of junks and twenty-one men.</p>

<p>&#8220;These two junks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have given me a great
deal of trouble for four days; they have blockaded the
place; neither a fishing nor a trading junk has been
able to get out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally, Captain St. John was surprised that two
miserable junks, with twenty-one men and a two-pounder
gun, could have effectively shut up a port in
such a way. The mandarin excused himself and his
people by saying that they were very, very scared of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
pirates, and on being asked if he hadn&#8217;t any soldiers,
replied that he had eight hundred ashore. Eight
hundred soldiers, and a hundred or so junks knocking
about the harbour, and yet the two pirate craft could
hold up a whole port&#8217;s trade for over half a week! And
the port had 4,000 inhabitants!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the captain to the mandarin, &#8220;if I were
a Chinaman, I think I would turn pirate at once. They
must lead very jolly, independent lives!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they do,&#8221; answered the mandarin, not appreciating
the captain&#8217;s humour. &#8220;The only things they
fear are English gunboats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pickshui, one of the strongholds of the pirates, had
already been burned down twice by Captain St. John;
but, having been rebuilt, it was determined that once
and for all it should be razed to the ground. A large
expedition, consisting of fifty-three war-junks, sixteen
hundred Chinese troops, four English gunboats and a
steamer was detailed to do this, Captain St. John being
in command, though the part of his own little force was
rather to encourage the Chinese than anything else.
The armada arrived off Pickshui, which from its situation
was as good a place for the pirates to lurk in as
could be found. The way in was through a channel
between two islands, and vessels passing through were
at the mercy of the pirate junks inside. The mandarin
in charge of the Chinese section of the expedition knew
this, and was pathetic in his refusal to venture in, or
allow his own ships to do so, unless an English gunboat
led the way. So in went the English, followed by the
Chinese, who, indicative of their dread of the pirates,
directed a heavy fire upon the village before they
dared land a single man. Then, when they had plucked
up sufficient courage, the celestial warriors leaped
ashore, and a great mass of them rushed at the village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
from which the inhabitants fled in terror. Then looting
began; and afterwards the village was burned to
the ground&mdash;for the third time.</p>

<p>But the work was not done; large numbers of pirates
were hidden amongst the trees, and kept up a continual
fire upon the Chinese troops who were told to clear
them out of the woods. Eight hundred of the soldiers
were detailed for this task, and for a time they kept up
a brisk, though useless, because ill-directed, fire upon
the pirates. Then they refused to advance a single
inch; it was only courting death, they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My troops cannot take the place!&#8221; cried the
mandarin to Captain St. John, in an awful agony of
spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in at them,&#8221; exclaimed the captain, &#8220;and they&#8217;ll
run as fast as their legs can carry them!&#8221;</p>

<p>A blank refusal was the only answer, and the captain
realised that if the expedition was to be a success, he
would have to make it so. He therefore promised to
help, and, taking one sailor and one marine, he landed
and went to where the Imperial cowards were waiting.
The mandarin, fear written all over his face, took his
stand with his men, but the captain and his two companions
went forward alone, getting close up to where
the pirates were concealed.</p>

<p>These three intrepid men opened fire upon the
lurkers, and what all the desultory firing of the Imperial
troops had failed to do, they did; they alone sent the
pirates fleeing for their lives!</p>

<p>And that little affair upset the ruffians at Pickshui!</p>

<p>How scared the pirates were of a handful of Englishmen
is shown by an encounter which Captain St. John
had with them in another little bay, where the gunboat
could not enter, the entrance being too narrow and the
water too shallow. As the pirate junks would be lined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
up inside, ready to meet with a heavy fire any attacking
boats, some other way had to be devised, and the
captain hit on a method which, as it turned out, was
successful. He landed at a spot some distance from
the entrance, taking seven men with him, and arranging
for another boat to put out when the gunboat reached
the entrance of the channel.</p>

<p>The way to the pirates&#8217; rendezvous lay through a
quarter of a mile of scrubby bush and long grass, and
up the side of a hill. Cautiously this ground was
covered and the summit of the hill reached. Down in
the bay lay three large junks, broadside on to the entrance,
ready to give a good fight to any who tried to
get in. Their men were at the guns, twenty-six in all&mdash;a
fair armament, and one likely to cause havoc in any
boats which dare attempt to enter. As for men, there
were about ten to one against the English; but the job
had to be done.</p>

<p>Grounded on the shore was a small sampan, hidden
from the junks by some trees; and Captain St. John
resolved that he would have this sampan. Just as he
had made up his mind to obtain it, the gunboat appeared
at the entrance and the pirates began to get to
business. But before they had a chance to fire, St.
John and three of his men had scrambled into the
sampan, pushed off, and took them in the rear. They
were seen immediately, before ever they got near enough
to board, and the three other men, who were coming
along the shore, were also seen.</p>

<p>Never were mortals so scared as were those poor
pirates! Seven men&mdash;white men, Englishmen! So
vast an army had come out against them! It was more
than piratic endurance and pluck could stand; and over
the side went the raiders, some being fortunate enough
to drop into the boats alongside, others tumbling headlong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
into the water. Such a scene you never saw! Such
yells of fear you never heard!</p>

<p>And four of those seven men were in a sampan that
simply refused to be steered, but spun round and round
and round, so that they could neither get aboard nor
grab any of the pirates. Then, to add to the consternation
of the ruffians, another boat, with more
Englishmen, appeared in the entrance; and there were
no men at the guns to fire the grapeshot which they
had hoped would blow the sailors from the sea!</p>

<p>And instead of doing that the pirates splashed and
scrambled about in frantic efforts to reach shore, all of
them managing to do so except about half a dozen who
were taken prisoners. Then the Englishmen had a
bonfire, the junks forming the fuel for it.</p>

<p>Truly, pirate-hunting in the Far East is a fine sport!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A VOYAGE OF DANGER</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Mutiny on the <i>Flowery Land</i></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is significant to note that, in the merchant service,
most of the mutinies on the record of shame have
as their ringleaders&mdash;and rank and file&mdash;foreign sailors
aboard British ships; and the mutiny on board the
<i>Flowery Land</i> was no exception.</p>

<p>The <i>Flowery Land</i>, laden with wines, and a mixed
cargo besides, left the Port of London on July 28, 1863,
bound for Singapore. Crew and officers numbered
twenty, the captain bearing the honest, if common,
name of John Smith; with him, as a passenger, sailed
his brother George.</p>

<p>They had not been at sea long before Captain Smith
found that he had a very tough set of men to deal with.
They were a cosmopolitan crowd&mdash;Spaniards, Turks,
Greeks, Norwegians, Chinamen, and a sprinkling of
Englishmen, these latter being Karswell, the first mate,
and William Taffir, the second mate. The seamen,
being far from sweet-tempered, and giving evidence
every now and then of insubordination, had to be taken
pretty strongly in hand, which took the form of rope&#8217;s-ending
some of them occasionally to quell their unruly
spirits. Such treatment, however, only seemed to arouse
the antipathy of the crew, who secretly plotted against
the captain and his officers; and when one day George
Carlos, the Greek, after a particularly flagrant piece of
insubordination, was hauled on deck and strapped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the bulwark for a while, it made them more determined
than ever to get their own back. Not that this treatment
of Carlos was anything out of the way; it was a very
frequent form of punishment for the law-breaker at sea.
And, as a matter of fact, Carlos did not get all he deserved,
for Captain Smith took pity on him, and had
him released sooner than he need have done, and went
so far as to physic him and let him go to his bunk for
a rest.</p>

<p>But what harsh treatment did not effect, kind was
unable to, and Carlos nursed revenge in his heart. With
his cosmopolitan comrades he worked up a mutiny
which broke out on September 10, at about three o&#8217;clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>The captain was below at the time, and Karswell was
on deck, it being his watch; and the conspirators had
timed things so that the two could not help each other.
Suddenly the storm burst; one party made a rush for
Karswell, who, taken unawares, was felled to the deck
with handspikes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; he cried in his agony; but the ruffians
were out for blood, and, not heeding his cries, struck
him again and again, battering in his head and smashing
his face. Then, having taken so much of revenge, they
picked the still screaming man up from the deck, carried
him to the side, and heaved him into the sea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down in the cabin, the captain had heard
the noise, and, jumping up, had rushed half-way up the
companion-way. He got no farther; several men met
him, including Francisco Blanco and Brasilio de los
Santos, and, armed with handspikes and daggers, they
fell upon him with fury. Clinging to the ladder, seeking
to work his way up, the captain was hacked,
stabbed, and stabbed again, and then chased below and
beaten till his body was racked with pain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>Taffir, the second mate, also roused by the hubbub,
tried to get on to the deck, but was stopped by a
struggling crowd on the companion, who were treating
another man as they had treated the captain. A
handspike sent him spinning down again; but once
more he ran up, and caught hold this time of the man,
and tried to pull him out of danger. He did not know
then what had happened to Smith, and he called out
lustily on the captain for help. There was no answer;
only another blow that sent him hurtling below.</p>

<p>Picking himself up, he ran to the captain&#8217;s cabin,
only to find it empty. From there he hurried to the
main cabin, and here the flickering light of the untrimmed
lamp showed him the captain lying in a pool
of blood. The mutineers had finished him off there.
He was dead. Half maddened by the horror of it all,
Taffir rushed to the berth of the captain&#8217;s brother. That
also was empty. George Smith had been beaten on the
head with handspikes till the life was out of him, and
then had been pitched overboard. Realising now that
there was little mercy being shown to whoever fell into
the mutineers&#8217; hands, Taffir sought safety in his own
cabin, where he locked himself in, and waited in anguish
for about three-quarters of an hour, refusing to answer
the calls of the seamen as they pounded at his door.</p>

<p>In the meantime the mutineers were having a clean
sweep up; they knocked the carpenter, Michael Anderson,
on the head, and ransacked the ship to see what
they could find. Then they bethought themselves of
Taffir again. Although he did not know it, Taffir was
destined to be saved, for the sole reason that, now that
they had disposed of the other officers, he was the only
man who knew anything about navigation; and, even
when you&#8217;ve got a ship in your hands, it&#8217;s not much
use unless you can do something with it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>So down they went to Taffir&#8217;s cabin, and on his
refusing to open the door to them, they smashed it in
and marched into the cabin, where, as bloodstained,
ruffianly looking a crew as man ever saw, they stood
in a half-circle round his berth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out!&#8221; cried John Lyons, a Spaniard. &#8220;Come
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thinking that acquiescence was the safest thing,
Taffir got out and stood before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to kill me?&#8221; he asked, anxiously
waiting for the answer, and half fearing what it might
be. He had little reason to expect mercy from men
who had so far shown none.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lyons. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve killed the skipper
and the mate, and the captain&#8217;s brother has got away
somewhere. We want you to work the ship to somewhere.
Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment or so Taffir thought. To say &#8220;Yes&#8221;
was to lend himself to the crime; to say &#8220;No&#8221; was to
ask for death. And, after all, refusing would do nothing
for the men who had been killed, whereas to agree might
lead to the bringing of the ruffians to justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said presently, and the party went
on deck again.</p>

<p>Going to the main cabin, Taffir saw that Captain
Smith&#8217;s body had a rope round it, and that Watto, the
Turk, was going to haul it up on deck to heave it
overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold! Let me sew it up in canvas,&#8221; cried
Taffir, with all the sailor&#8217;s reverence for the dead;
and the mutineers, knowing that, after all, they must
humour the mate, consented. Taffir performed his sad
office, and Captain Smith had a decent burial at sea,
minus the service.</p>

<p>It was five o&#8217;clock before Taffir went up on deck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and as he did so he passed Santos, who flourished a
big knife at him, as though he would much like to do
with Taffir as he had done with the captain.</p>

<p>Having seen that the ship was going all right, Taffir
went back to the cabin, and remained there till about
eight o&#8217;clock, when all the hands except the man at the
wheel came down to interview him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into the captain&#8217;s cabin,&#8221; said Lyon sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Taffir asked, though he had already
guessed what was afoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to see what money and clothes he&#8217;d got,&#8221;
was the reply; and although he did not say so, Lyons&#8217;s
idea was that, if they got Taffir there, and made him
share with them, they could say that he was a party to
the whole affair.</p>

<p>Needs must when the devil drives; and so Taffir went
into the cabin, standing by while Santos, Blanco,
Carlos, Watto, and Lopez ransacked it for everything
of value. They broke open boxes and chests, wrenched
open the desks, and, gathering all the money they could
find, took it into the main cabin, where they laid it upon
the table for division.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dole it out in seventeen parts,&#8221; said Lyons to
Taffir.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; screamed the Turk. &#8220;Make it eight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said Lyons threateningly, and Taffir
thought that the thieves were going to quarrel amongst
themselves. However, the matter was smoothed over,
and Lyons had his own way.</p>

<p>Into seventeen parts the money was divided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s yours,&#8221; said Lyons to the mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t touch a cent of it,&#8221; said Taffir, seeing what
the idea was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do as I tell you,&#8221; cried Lyons, &#8220;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He let the rest go by default, and Taffir knew what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
he meant. There was nothing for it, and, taking the
share, the mate carried it to one of the writing-desks
and put it in there, though he never saw it again.
Perhaps the greedy Turk had it.</p>

<p>Next the mutineers allotted out the captain&#8217;s clothes,
though they did not give Taffir a share of them. When
they came to Smith&#8217;s watch they decided that, as they
couldn&#8217;t very well divide that, they would keep it till
they landed, when they might be able to sell it. The
timepiece was therefore put into the writing-desk with
Taffir&#8217;s money; but that also disappeared, and later
was a source of trouble.</p>

<p>Having settled up these little matters fairly amicably,
the question was to get to land, and Taffir was made to
navigate the vessel, while the crew, when it was not
necessary for them to work, regaled themselves with
champagne and overhauled the cargo for valuables.</p>

<p>For some days everything went on smoothly, and
then a ship was sighted. She proved to be the <i>Friends</i>,
of Liverpool, and Taffir steered the <i>Flowery Land</i> towards
her. Acting on instructions from Carlos, who
was in charge of the ship, and had ordered her to be
set for Buenos Ayres, under threat of death Taffir told
the <i>Friends&#8217;</i> captain that she was the <i>Louiza</i>, bound for
Valparaiso.</p>

<p>Then the two ships parted company; and barely had
the <i>Friends</i> got away when the crew rushed towards
Taffir, and, with daggers drawn, stood and jabbered
at him like so many monkeys. Although he couldn&#8217;t
understand what they were saying, there was no mistaking
their attitude. Evidently they were angry with
him for something, and it would have gone ill with
Taffir had not Lyons come along. Quieting the angry
crew, he abstracted from them the fact that they thought
Taffir had just told the <i>Friends</i> the whole story of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
mutiny. Lyons soon put them right on that little
matter, and they went back to their champagne,
appeased.</p>

<p>The incident showed Taffir how slender was the
thread on which his life hung, and he knew that he
would have to be careful, for if these men suspected
that he was playing them false there was little doubt
that they would kill him out of hand, and risk what
happened afterwards. They were like so many madmen,
and one day Taffir saw the Turk go up to the Chinese
steward and gash his arm open with a large knife for
no apparent reason whatever. It turned out that they
were forcing him to collect all the ship&#8217;s papers, which
they threw overboard. Then they had a row about the
captain&#8217;s watch, which was missing, and accused Taffir
of having stolen it. It never was found, and was a sore
point all through.</p>

<p>On October 2 land was sighted, and now that they
had no further use for him, the mutineers sent Taffir
to Coventry. No one spoke to him or took any notice
of him; they even refused to let him work the ship,
which they turned about. They sent Taffir to his cabin
then, where he remained all day. At night Blanco went
down and ordered him up on deck, where he found
that they were clewing up the sails and getting the
boats out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; he asked Lyons.</p>

<p>No answer; only surly looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going to be done with the ship?&#8221; he asked
another of the Spaniards present, Marsolino. &#8220;And
what about me? Are you going to kill me?&#8221; For
Taffir was convinced that momentous things were about
to take place.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to scuttle the ship,&#8221; said Marsolino.
&#8220;And as for you&#8221;&mdash;he leered&mdash;&#8220;as for you, I&#8217;m not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
going to kill you&mdash;but I rather think Blanco is,&#8221; he
added grimly.</p>

<p>Naturally, Taffir was now all anxiety. Here he was,
with a ship full of mutineers whose hands were already
stained with innocent blood, and who were evidently
preparing to leave the ship he had navigated for them.
What a prospect was before him! He could almost
feel the dagger eating its way into his body as the
bloodthirsty Blanco looked across at him every now
and again.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour of such anxiety passed,
and then Taffir was flung into one of the boats, which
contained the cook, the steward, Frank Powell, Watto,
and the ship&#8217;s boy, named Early. Evidently he was
not going to be murdered after all. In another boat,
riding at the stern, were several other men, while the
rest were still on board the <i>Flowery Land</i>.</p>

<p>Presently the boat in which Taffir had been thrown
was pulled away from the ship, but had only gone about
a hundred yards when those on the <i>Flowery Land</i> called
her back. Taffir&#8217;s heart sank. Was he, after all, going
to be hauled back to death? He took heart again the
next instant, for the men in the boat, with the exception
of Watto, did not want to go back, and refused to pull
towards the ship. Powell, who steered, refused to turn
her head round, and Taffir thanked him in the silence
of his own heart. Suddenly Watto, seizing an oar,
threatened to knock Powell&#8217;s brains out if he didn&#8217;t do
as he was told; and the boat&#8217;s head swung round, and
she sped towards the ship. They were anxious moments
for poor Taffir, whose mind was not set at rest when
Lyons, on the <i>Flowery Land</i>, ordered the lot of them
to get back on deck.</p>

<p>Why they were called back Taffir did not know,
and was not told; probably it was because the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
did not want one boat to start before the rest. Anyhow,
for a long time Taffir was kept on deck; and though he
could see but little in the darkness, he heard the noise
made as the scoundrels loaded the boats, not forgetting
the champagne, bottles of which they lowered into the
craft riding at the sides. The Chinese steward fell into
the water while trying to get aboard from the boat, and
while struggling for life was pelted with bottles of
champagne till he sank. Taffir saw his own fate there.</p>

<p>Soon, however, as though to prolong his agony,
they threw him into a boat, this time the one in which
Lyons and Blanco were to sail. The fact that it was
Blanco&#8217;s boat was anything but pleasing to Taffir, who
remembered what Marsolino had told him, and trembled
for his life. Durrano and Lopez, other Spaniards, also
got into this boat, which was presently pushed off;
and almost immediately afterwards the <i>Flowery Land</i>,
which had been scuttled, and had begun to settle some
time before, gave a final plunge and dived beneath the
surface. Through the darkness Taffir could see the
Chinese boy and the cook clinging to the top; they had
been left to their fate, and not a hand was held out to
save them.</p>

<p>Lyons&#8217;s boat towed the other towards land, which
was reached at four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon of
October 9. Taffir was told that, if he valued his life,
he was to say that the vessel was an American ship
from Peru, bound for Bordeaux, and that she had
foundered a hundred miles from land, that the captain
had got into one boat, and had not been seen since,
and that the two boats which had come ashore had been
at sea for five days and nights.</p>

<p>In his heart Taffir had made up his mind to tell
of the tragedy as soon as an opportunity presented itself.
That night the party slept at a farmhouse, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
next day the farmer drove them to Rocha. Watching
his time, Taffir managed to find out that at a place
called Camp, twenty miles away, was a man named
Ramoz, who could speak English; and one night he
slipped out of Rocha and made his way to Camp. He
located Ramoz, to whom he told his tale, and later he
was taken to the authorities, where once more he recited
the events that had taken place on the <i>Flowery Land</i>,
with the result that eight of the mutineers were captured,
and in due course put on their trial at the Central
Criminal Court, London. Lyons, Durrano, Santos,
Watto, Blanco, Marsolino, and Lopez were found
guilty of murder, Carlos being acquitted.</p>

<p>Altogether, the mutiny of the <i>Flowery Land</i> is a
lurid story of the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GUARDIANS OF THE COAST</h2>


<p class="ph1">Stories of Coastguards and Lighthousemen</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH the coastguard and lighthouseman live
their lives on land, they are inalienably a part of
the sea and its story. Day by day, night by night, they
are on guard along the coasts, and never know what
may happen; but, whatever it is, they are ready.</p>

<p>And they are always modest of their achievements, as
the letters I have received from some of them testify.
It&#8217;s the hardest thing in the world to get them to talk
about themselves; but, by dint of judicious questioning,
I managed to get some of them to give me the
plain stories of what really did happen.</p>

<p>The first concerns Lighthouseman William Hunter,
of Flamborough Head, who, standing outside the lighthouse
on a fine morning, talking with his superior
officer, saw a gallant little band of boys of the Lads&#8217;
Brigade coming along. Presently there was a sharp
command, and the lookers-on saw the boys disperse,
and in a few minutes the laddies were scattered here,
there, and everywhere, enjoying themselves to the full.</p>

<p>But suddenly there was the blare of bugles, the cries
of boys, the hoarse shouts of men, and Hunter turned
quickly to his officer and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and have a look,&#8221; was the reply; and off went
the lighthouse-keeper. Following the sounds, he found
himself down on the beach, just below the lighthouse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
What a sight met his eyes! Before him was a group of
boys staring up the cliff, fear writ large upon their faces
as they saw one of their comrades clinging frenziedly to
a shrub, able neither to go up nor to come down, while
down on the beach, amongst the boulders, lay the
huddled form of another boy.</p>

<p>The two boys had been engaged in a wild scramble
up the cliff, seeing which could reach the top first.
Half-way up the foremost boy had displaced a large
stone, which hurtled down, hit his comrade, and sent
him tumbling down to the beach, where he now lay with
a broken arm.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy above realised what had happened,
fear took possession of him; his wits left him,
and he, finding that he had reached a position where it
was impossible to move with safety either way, he sent
up haunting screams for help! As though the call had
been necessary! The boys on the beach had seen the
accident, and instantly the bugles had blared out their
calls for help. And so Hunter had arrived on the
scene.</p>

<p>Like lightning he dashed across an intervening gut
of water, slipping over seaweed as he went, and
stumbling over rocks till he reached the foot of the cliff.
Then, hand over hand, gingerly but quickly, Hunter
made his way up the cliff, seizing anything that seemed
likely to afford a handhold to help him up; now making
a fierce grab for a shrub as the earth gave way beneath
him. And at last, after a feverish few minutes, during
which the watchers down below held their breath and
the folk above sent for further help, he came almost
within reach of the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, sonny!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come quickly!&#8221; cried the boy, shaking with fear.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t hold out much longer!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Spurred on by the evident terror of the lad, Hunter
covered the last few feet quickly, and came alongside
him just in the nick of time, for the youth was almost
exhausted. His hands were bruised and cut from clutching
at stones, and the lighthouseman&#8217;s were little better.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right now, sonny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
soon have you down.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, though he said the comforting words, there was
a little thought at the back of his mind that it might be
some time before they reached safety, for he, too, found
that the position was none too safe a one; that while he
himself might have been able to get away alone, he
could not hope to carry the unfortunate boy without
further help. There was no use in looking down; help
could not come that way. But it might come from
above, and, glancing up, his heart gave a great bound
as he saw that the coastguards, under Chief Officer
Young, had arrived on the scene, bringing with them
the one thing that was necessary&mdash;a rope! It was a
very lifeline to Hunter.</p>

<p>Down the rope fell; and then the lighthouseman saw
that, owing to the projecting edge of the cliff, it hung
more than an arm&#8217;s length away from him. He would
have to move carefully away in order to reach it. The
boy seemed to realise this, and before Hunter moved an
inch he called out in fear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me, sir. I can&#8217;t hold on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, see here, laddie,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;You&#8217;re
all right. I won&#8217;t let go of you. But I&#8217;ve got to get
that rope. Keep still.&#8221; And, holding on to the boy
with one hand, he moved gingerly away, digging his
heels deep in the cliffside as he did so to get a purchase.
Once, twice, nay, thrice he tried to catch the rope, and
at last did so; but the strain of holding the boy at the
same time that he reached out for it was terrible, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the soft earth gave way more than once, threatening to
send the pair of them hurtling below.</p>

<p>So far, so good. The next task was to fasten the
boy on the rope. Once again footholds had to be dug
in the cliff&mdash;deep holes that would not give way beneath
his weight as he laboured. Adept at knotting, accustomed
to work of this kind, Hunter soon had the boy
fast in the rope. And then:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower away!&#8221; he cried; and the coastguards let
the rope out inch by inch, while the rescuer steadied
it, and kept it from swinging round and round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy!&#8221; he yelled, as clods of earth and great
stones, dislodged by the rope as it slid over the edge,
came tumbling about his ears, threatening to knock
him from his perch, threatening, too, to smash into the
boy being lowered to safety. And &#8220;easy&#8221; it was!
Those coastguards knew their work.</p>

<p>At last it was done; the boy was on the beach,
thoroughly shaken, dreadfully scared, but safe, thanks
to the pluck of the lighthouseman, who was soon hauled
to the top, and, as he told me, &#8220;went indoors and forgot
all about it&#8221; until later he received a letter from the
secretary to the Carnegie Hero Fund Trustees, commending
him on his bravery and suitably rewarding
him, though it goes without saying that his best reward
was the knowledge that he had been able to save the
life of the unfortunate youth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> when the sun is shining in a blue sky overhead
there is an awesome splendour in the majestic ruggedness
of the coast about Land&#8217;s End; but when the grey
fingers of the dawn are creeping into the heavens, and
the elements are waging a tumultuous war, when waves
dash with tremendous force upon the rocks, to break
upon them with a resounding roar, and when some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
unfortunate ship has been caught in the grip of the
storm, then the scene is sufficient to strike terror into
strong hearts.</p>

<p>Such was the scene on the morning of March 15,
1914, at five o&#8217;clock, when the coastguard at Sennen
Cove was alarmed to see signals of a vessel in distress.
Away along the coast could be seen the dark hull of
a ship, stationary, except when great seas beat upon
her and shook her from end to end. Ever and anon
the rockets whizzed into the air, brilliant appeals for
help. Instantly all was activity; the life-saving
apparatus and the lifeboat were summoned, and the
work of rescue had begun.</p>

<p>Coastguard A. Oddy, of Sennen, was in charge of
the life-saving apparatus. There was no time to be
wasted, for the scene of the wreck was four miles away,
and every minute was precious, for it could not be long
before the vessel broke in two, hurling her human
freight to an awful death.</p>

<p>The wagon was got ready, the horses put in, and
away went the wagon at top speed. Just as daylight
was breaking the coastguards reached the point of the
coast off which the unfortunate ship lay. What a sight
met their eyes! The ship, the Swedish barque
<i>Trifolium</i>, had been taken up by the waves and hurled
ashore as though she had been but a shuttlecock. She
was held fast by the rocks, with a boiling sea around
her, with mountainous waves rearing angry heads,
which dropped with a staggering shock and a thunderous
roar upon the deck, long since deserted by the
crew. To have remained there would have been to
court death, for no man could keep a footing on that
sloping deck, swept every minute by heavy seas.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_200.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;To the rigging they fled, scrambling up in frenzied haste&#8221;</p>

<p>So to the rigging they fled, scrambling up in frenzied
haste, and hanging on like grim death, watching, waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
for some answer out of the darkness to their appeals
for help. As they saw the life-savers pull up upon the
shore they raised a faint cheer. They were numbed,
wet to the skin; they had been staring death in the face
for what had seemed an eternity; and now help was at
hand. Men would cheer then, even if it were with their
last breath!</p>

<p>Oddy and his companions immediately set to work
to rescue those seven luckless men. The tackle was got
out, the rocket apparatus fixed up, and the next instant
a rocket went speeding away across the tumult of the
waters, carrying a lifeline. It went right over the vessel,
as also did a second one that was fired; but, though
the lines were across their ship, the men in the rigging
dared not leave their hold, precarious though it was, to
fix the lifelines, by means of which they could have been
hauled ashore. To have left the rigging for the deck
would have been fatal. The avalanche of water that fell
upon the ship, and swirled away every loosened thing,
was too terrifying to face; certain and awful death lay
that way.</p>

<p>So, with help so near, the sailors clung to the
rigging, wide-eyed, anxious-faced, wondering what
could be done, what would happen. Very soon they
realised that whether they jumped or not, there was
nothing but death before them, for the ship, buffeted
by the waves, rolled dangerously on the rocks, and
seemed as if about to heel over.</p>

<p>One man, taking his fate in his hands, watched his
opportunity, and, fully dressed in oilskins as he was,
suddenly let go of the rigging and jumped. Luckily he
jumped wide enough, and plunged into the boiling surf
below; had he fallen on to the deck he would have
been smashed to pieces. His friends in the rigging
gasped, staggered at the risk he took; the watchers on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the shore shuddered as they saw him disappear beneath
the waters; but all heaved a sigh of relief when they
saw him reappear and begin to battle with the seas.
He was making for one of the lifelines.</p>

<p>Cumbered with his oilskins, weighed down by his
heavy sea-boots, the man struck out boldly for the line.
Yard by yard he drew nearer to it, and it seemed that
he would reach it; then he was caught upon the crest
of a wave, was flung high, dropped low, and the line
was as far away as ever! Yet once again he made for
it, and, after a terrific fight, he managed to grasp the
line. Staying awhile to take breath and gather his
strength for the final struggle, he turned towards the
shore, and began to haul himself along by means of the
rope. The men in the rigging watched and waited;
it meant much to them, this fight with the sea, for if
their comrade won through, they might do so as well.
The rescuers on shore stood to their work, waiting for
the man to come nearer in, and ready to plunge to his
assistance, if necessary.</p>

<p>Yard by yard he drew nearer, and the coastguard
could see that he was almost at the last gasp; it was a
case of going to his help. Instantly Coastguard Oddy
answered the call of duty. With neither lifeline nor
lifebuoy he went into the boiling sea. By a stroke of
luck he missed the hidden rocks, on which he might
have been pounded to death, and in a few moments
reached the now drowning man, whom he seized with
a strong hand, and snatched from the maw of the sea
in the very nick of time. Then he set out to the shore
with his burden. It was, indeed, a fight for life, the
struggle of a brave man with the force of a mighty sea,
which, as though taunting him, let him get within an
ace of safety, and then flung him back into the angry
cauldron of the deep. Foiled, but by no means beaten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Oddy once more set his teeth and struck out for the
shore, still holding his precious burden. On and on
he went, and then back again, only to push forward
with more determination; and the coastguard fought
his fight to such good purpose that at last he was again
near the shore, found a footing, drew himself up, and
proceeded to drag the helpless man after him.</p>

<p>But in the moment of his victory the angry foe, as
if to rob him of this life won from the jaws of death,
returned to the fray; a mighty wave swooped down upon
him, there was a noise as though heaven and earth had
met as the wave fell in a thunderous roar upon the rocks,
the sailor was wrenched from Oddy&#8217;s grasp, and he
himself flung heavily on to the rocks.</p>

<p>He had tried valiantly&mdash;but he had failed! So said
the men who watched him in his fight for a fellow-man&#8217;s
life. They saw him now, unable to move, his legs
jammed between rocks so that he could not free them.
It seemed but a matter of minutes ere he should be
sacrificed on the altar of heroism.</p>

<p>Oddy strained every effort to free himself. Even in
that moment of peril he wondered what had happened
to the sailor, and realised that unless something almost
miraculous happened the end had come. There was no
fear of death, only the thought of having failed in what
he had so bravely set out to do. And for it all to end
like this!</p>

<p>Then the miracle happened. The very sea that had
conquered him set him free! Wave after wave had
broken over him, and presently one of greater volume
than any of the others hit him with such force that
it did for him what he himself had tried so vainly to do;
it lifted him out of the imprisoning rocks. He was free!
Flung face downwards on the rocks, Oddy felt the sea
rushing over him, and as the force of it spent itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
he got upon his feet, and, counting not the danger, went
back for the drowning man.</p>

<p>He found him&mdash;whether alive or dead he knew not&mdash;but
without loss of time struck out with him for the
shore, and, after another stern fight, succeeded in
getting him into safety&mdash;alive. It had all been worth
while!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the men on the <i>Trifolium</i> had been
watching anxiously and hopelessly, for it seemed to
them that it was useless to expect to be saved. But as
soon as they saw their comrade safely ashore they took
heart. If it were possible to save him, then they might
all be saved. A second man plunged boldly into the
surf, seized a lifeline, and hauled himself within reach
of the shore. Several of the coastguards pluckily went
to his assistance and got him out.</p>

<p>Before the other five men on the vessel had time to
follow the example of their comrades the sea had completed
its fell work. It pounded upon the hapless ship,
wrenched her plates apart, battered her sides and tore
great holes in her. Held fast as she was by the cruel
rocks, there was but one end to her&mdash;she broke her back.
The great iron vessel parted amidships as though she
had been a toy, and in that instant, with death all around
them, the five men in the rigging jumped. They were
in the nick of time; another minute, and they would have
been crashed to death with the wreck of what was once
a proud vessel. Three of them found lifelines, and were
hauled towards the shore; and once again Oddy plunged
into the surf and succeeded in bringing one of them to
safety, while in the case of the others, Oddy and two
other life-savers joined efforts and managed to rescue
them. The remaining two men who had been on the
ship unfortunately died; one was killed by a falling
mast, the other was drowned, and though he was got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
ashore, and artificial respiration was used for nearly
four hours, it was all in vain; death had claimed him.</p>

<p>For seven hours the rescuers had watched and
worked, and had not worked in vain; and when Lieutenant
A. S. Chambers, R.N., the divisional officer,
arrived on the scene, he had the gratification of knowing
that, although he had not been present, his men
had done their duty nobly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GREAT NAVAL DISASTERS</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Loss of the <i>Formidable</i> and the <i>Victoria</i></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YOU never know when anything may happen,&#8221;
wrote Captain Noel Loxley, of H.M.S. <i>Formidable</i>
a day or so before 1915 elbowed 1914 into the past;
and before the New Year was much more than an hour
old H.M.S. <i>Formidable</i> was holed by a German torpedo,
and Loxley and a gallant band of noble sailors died
like heroes for their king and country.</p>

<p>The <i>Formidable</i> left Sheerness on December 31 with
a crew of 750 men, all in high spirits, to keep vigil on
the Channel. At 1.30 next morning she was steaming
at about eighteen knots, fighting her way through a
south-westerly gale, a bright moon shining overhead
when not obscured by thin clouds that sifted a drizzly
rain upon her as she drove at the high seas.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the howl of the wind and the
thump of the engines, there was the report of a thunderous
explosion on the starboard bow. The ship
seemed to shiver, then reel. Down in the stokeholds
men looked at each other in wonder; like the noise of
a distant gun the sound came to them, and they thought,
and hoped, that it meant an engagement with the enemy.
Then again, from port, this time, there came another
of those muffled reports&mdash;so near that they knew something
had hit their ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Torpedoed!&#8221; said one. &#8220;By Heaven, they&#8217;ve got
us!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>And up on the bridge, standing there with his
commander, Ballard, Captain Loxley also muttered
&#8220;Torpedoed!&#8221; Its periscope hidden by the darkness
and the swelling of the seas, a German submarine had
crept up within striking distance, had launched her
two death-tubes, seen them take effect, and then slunk
away into the night.</p>

<p>Immediately he realised what had happened, Loxley,
as calm as though he were at practice, ordered the water-tight
doors to be closed and the men to be piped to
collision quarters. Up on to the deck the startled men
swarmed&mdash;startled men, truly, but calm&mdash;men who could
stand at attention in the face of death and laugh and
joke about &#8220;A fine New Year&#8217;s gift for us, this!&#8221; Men
who could cry as they stood naked and shivering on the
deck, &#8220;Here we are again! Undress uniform&mdash;swimming
costume!&#8221; Men, too, who could enter into the
spirit of the captain on the bridge, who could signal to
another ship in the neighbourhood:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep off! Submarines are about!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loxley knew what might happen to that ship if she
stood by, as he had no doubt her officers would be
prompted to do. Only a month or so before three British
cruisers had been sunk in the North Sea, two of them
through standing by to help the other. The Admiralty
had issued an order that in such circumstances ships
were not to attempt rescue work, but, as if to make
assurance doubly sure, Loxley had given his signal; he
wanted no risks to be run; he and his men were willing
to take their chance of life and death without bringing
others into danger. It is the spirit of the British Navy.</p>

<p>But if he would not allow others to help them, he
used all his efforts to save his crew. There was no
hope for the <i>Formidable</i>, he knew, and she would have
to be abandoned. She was listing to starboard already.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;Out pinnaces and the launch!&#8221; was the order, and
while the boat crews worked to carry it out there came
another: &#8220;&#8217;Way barges 1 and 2!&#8221; Lieutenant Simmonds
superintended the lowering of the boats, and by
his fine work earned Loxley&#8217;s encomium, &#8220;Well done,
Simmonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into one boat there scrambled seventy or eighty men,
and she got away from the starboard side; soon after a
second boat, with seventy men, pushed off from the port
side, and, acting on instructions, she remained near the
sinking ship for about an hour. All this time the gale
had been blowing fiercely, and mountainous seas made
the work of hoisting away the boats anything but easy.
It was, indeed, found impossible to lower further boats,
because the ship listed so much that only the starboard
boats could be hauled out. One barge which they tried
to launch slipped in the davits, and hurled her crew of
sixty men into the water below. Dozens of men leapt
overboard and swam to the two successfully lowered
boats, and the captain, thinking of others all the time,
told the boats to stand by and try to pick them up. The
darkness, however, prevented this being done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the <i>Formidable</i> was a strange scene.
On the deck stood lines of men, naked many of them,
calm all of them, puffing away at cigarettes or passing
along a smoke to a comrade who had not brought his up
from below. From somewhere there came the sound of
a piano; a man sat playing breezy tunes to cheer his
comrades in the face of death. In the stokeholds begrimed
heroes stuck to their posts until, with a lurch,
the ship knocked them off their feet and sent the fires
rushing out at them; heroes who, when the word came,
raked out the fires, while elsewhere engineers shut off
the steam&mdash;all so that, when the ship sank, there should
be no explosion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Not a man lost his head. Their example was pacing
the bridge, smoking, just as though the ship was riding
in harbour with anchors down. &#8220;Steady, men; it&#8217;s all
right!&#8221; he cried to them. &#8220;Be British! There&#8217;s life
left in the old ship yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was not much life; listing, she gave a
sudden plunge, and all knew that it was the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man for himself!&#8221; came the order; and those
that could jumped as she took her final plunge. About
half the company got clear of her; but the two boats
could not take many, and in addition to those in the
boats only seventy were saved&mdash;by a light cruiser which
later came upon the scene.</p>

<p>Loxley went down with his ship, as did hundreds
of the men, standing in line, saluting the Old Jack for
the last time. &#8220;The last impression on my mind,&#8221; said
a survivor, &#8220;was of a long line of saluting figures disappearing
below the skyline.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the men in the two boats there now began an
anxious time. Many of them had no clothes beyond
vests and pants&mdash;some none at all, and these had to be
wrapped in the few blankets that were in the boats. The
night was bitterly cold, the gale was blowing its hardest,
the sea was running high. The first boat that put off
found her difficulties at once; she shipped water by
the ton, and the men had to improvise bailers. Those
who had boots on took them off, and used these; a
blanket, held at each corner by a sailor, was also brought
into play for the purpose; caps and coats, too&mdash;every
man doing something to clear the boat of water. For
hours they toiled, expecting every minute to be their
last. All through the night, till early morning, they
drifted whither the waves would take them, and when
dawn came they found themselves out of sight of land,
with never a ship in view.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>During the night they sang the modern warriors&#8217;
song, &#8220;Tipperary,&#8221; till they grew tired even of that;
and the daylight brought them no relief from the
monotony, till, about nine o&#8217;clock, their hearts gave a
great leap. A liner appeared on the horizon. Shouting
lustily, they hoisted a blanket on an oar and waved it
madly, seeking to attract attention; but the liner changed
her course and dipped over the horizon, leaving them to
the waste of waters.</p>

<p>This hope of being taken up by a passing ship was
renewed no less than eleven times during the day, each
time to be dashed to the ground; and one survivor later
said that he didn&#8217;t think much of the look-out on those
ships.</p>

<p>As the day progressed the gale became stronger, and
the boat was pitching and rolling, swinging high upon
the crest of a wave, now racing down into the trough,
the men becoming drenched through again and again,
those who were nearly naked suffering extreme agony.
No less than nine of them died of exposure.</p>

<p>At about one o&#8217;clock land was sighted; but when
the crew, pulling sixteen oars, tried to make it, they
found that they could not cope with the strong tide
that was running. Darkness came, and found them still
adrift. Then their eyes were gladdened by the sight of
two red lights gleaming in the distance, and Leading
Seaman Carroll, who had been the life and soul of the
party, wielded his oar, with which he had all along been
steering, and kept the boat headed for the lights of hope.
Fortunately for them, the wind and tide were now with
them; otherwise, so exhausted were they, never would
they have made the haven&mdash;for haven it was. They
heard the sound of breakers, saw in the shimmering
moonlight the white foam of the water, pulled like mad
to the &#8220;Pull, boys, pull!&#8221; of Petty Officer Bing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
after seven miles of stiff rowing were caught in a mighty
wave that carried them straight to the beach at Lyme
Regis, where very soon crowds of people gathered to
give them help and drag them ashore, for they were too
exhausted to help themselves. They had been adrift
twenty-two hours.</p>

<p>It is time now to return to the second boat, which,
after having picked up as many swimming men as
possible, had to get away from the <i>Formidable</i>, lest she
be dashed into her side by the raging sea. The story
of the sufferings of the men in her is much the same as
the others; but in this case nearly all the oars were
smashed and the boat had a hole stove in her side. One
of the men, whipping off his pants, stuffed them into the
gap, and then sat there to keep them from being washed
away. The little craft filled with water time and time
again, and they bailed her out as fast as they could.</p>

<p>About nine o&#8217;clock in the morning someone noticed
a large fishing smack to windward, and an oar was
hoisted, with a black scarf on it as a signal of distress.
It was seen by John Clark, third hand on the smack
<i>Providence</i> (Captain Pillar, Brixham), and he immediately
told the captain and his comrades, the second hand,
Dan Taylor, the cook, and Pillar, the boy. Instantly
they fell to work, set the storm jib, shook out a reef in
the mainsail, and stood after the boat, which by this time
had drifted far away, and was continually hidden by the
heavy seas. Through the now blinding rain the smack
pushed, and, coming near, found that it was impossible
to get close enough on the present tack to do any good.
Captain Pillar therefore decided to take a desperate
chance; he would gybe the boat&mdash;that is, swing all
her sails over violently&mdash;and get upon the other tack,
which would put him in a much better position to effect
the rescue of the men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>This was done successfully; and then the fishermen
tried to get a rope to the boat. Three times they failed,
but at the fourth attempt the rope pitched into the boat,
where it was made fast, the other end being round the
capstan of the smack. Then, working his vessel in a
manner that won the praise of every sailor there, Pillar
hauled the boat to a berth at the stern, and eventually
got her to leeward.</p>

<p>Once alongside, Pillar gave the word, and the sailors
began to jump aboard the smack. It took half an hour
to get that bunch of men off, so difficult was the work
as a result of the gale; over thirty feet the waves mounted
sometimes, and many a man wellnigh tumbled into the
sea, from which his chance of rescue would have been
small.</p>

<p>When all were safe on board the <i>Providence</i>, Captain
Pillar turned her about and made for Brixham, his men
meanwhile attending to the comforts of the sailors, who
were exhausted and frozen to the bone. Hot coffee and
food were served out, and never did men enjoy a meal
as they did on board the <i>Providence</i> on that January
afternoon. Near Brixham the <i>Providence</i> fell in with
the <i>Dencade</i>, which took her in tow and brought her into
Brixham, where the people on the wharves heard the
lusty voices of men singing &#8220;Auld Lang Syne,&#8221; as
though for hours they had not been adrift, helpless,
hopeless, as though they had never felt the shock as the
<i>Formidable</i> received her fatal wound, as though they
had never stood face to face with death.</p>

<p>It is the cheery fortitude of the British Jack Tar that
has helped old England to the command of the sea; and
it is such men as Captain Pillar and his gallant crew
who reveal the courage that lives in the hearts of men
whose work keeps them in the field of peace&mdash;where as
great victories are won as on the field of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">While</span>, during war, great disasters such as that of the
<i>Formidable</i> are to be expected, when the wings of the
Angel of Peace are spread the shock of a catastrophe
is infinitely greater, because it comes when there seems
to be no reason why it should. Such was the case of
the loss of the <i>Victoria</i> battleship in June, 1893. A
steel-armoured turret-ship of 10,470 tons and 1,400 horsepower,
39 guns and 8 torpedo-tubes, she was the flagship
of Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon, commanding the
Mediterranean squadron, which, in addition to the
<i>Victoria</i>, consisted of twelve other vessels, including the
<i>Camperdown</i>, the ship which rammed her.</p>

<p>The squadron was steaming line abreast, bound from
Beyrout for Tripoli, and going at eight knots an hour,
when the admiral, calling his staff in, decided to form
the squadron in two columns ahead, six cables&#8217; length
(1,200 yards) apart, the course to be later on reversed by
the lines turning inwards. Staff-Commander Hawkins-Smith
pointed out that, as the turning circles of the
<i>Victoria</i> and the <i>Camperdown</i> (the latter leading the port
column) were six hundred yards (or three cables&#8217; length),
the inward turn would involve a collision between this
vessel and the <i>Victoria</i>, which was leading the starboard
column.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will require at least eight cables, sir,&#8221; said
Hawkins-Smith, to which Tryon replied, after a
moment&#8217;s thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it shall be eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The staff-commander left the cabin; and then the
admiral gave instructions to his flag-lieutenant to signal
the order for the man&#339;uvre he had in mind&mdash;to line
ahead <i>at six cables apart</i>. Tryon had evidently changed
his mind.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Victoria</i> several officers approached the
admiral, and queried him on the matter, pointing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
that he had agreed that eight cables&#8217; length was wanted.
But he adhered to his command, saying: &#8220;That&#8217;s all
right; leave it at six cables.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the fatal order fluttered in the breeze.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Markham, on the <i>Camperdown</i>, was
staggered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It is an impracticable
man&#339;uvre!&#8221; and did not answer back, thus
giving the <i>Victoria</i> to understand that he had not
grasped the signal. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said to Captain
Johnstone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do anything. I have not answered
the signal.&#8221; And then gave instructions for the flag-lieutenant
to ask for fuller instructions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the <i>Victoria</i> other signals were being
hoisted, asking Markham why he was not obeying
orders, and reproving him for it. The rear-admiral,
knowing it was his duty to obey, decided to do so,
thinking that Tryon must be intending to make a wider
circle, and so go outside the <i>Camperdown&#8217;s</i> division.</p>

<p>The two ships therefore turned inwards, Markham
and his officers watching the <i>Victoria</i> closely to see what
she would do. On the flagship, too, officers were discussing
the movement, and Captain Bourke asked Tryon
whether it would not be as well to do something to avoid
the collision he saw was inevitable. It was a case for
haste, he knew, and he had to repeat his question
hurriedly: &#8220;May I go astern full speed with the port
screw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tryon at last, and Bourke gave the
order. But it was too late; three minutes and a half
after the two ships had turned inwards the <i>Camperdown</i>,
although her engines had been reversed, crashed into
the starboard bow of the <i>Victoria</i>, hitting her about
twenty feet before the turret and forcing her way in
almost to the centre line.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Instantly excitement reigned on the <i>Victoria</i>; but the
crew, never losing their heads, rushed to carry out the
orders which were now flung hither and thither:</p>

<p>&#8220;Close the water-tight doors!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out collision mats!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands on deck!&#8221;</p>

<p>In rapid succession the orders came; the doors were
shut tight, the mats were hung over the side, where,
so great was the gap left when the <i>Camperdown</i> backed
away, the water rushed in in torrents. Captain Bourke,
having visited the engine-rooms to see that all that was
possible had been done, rushed up on deck, and there
found that the <i>Victoria</i> had a heavy list to starboard.
On the deck all the sick men and the prisoners had been
brought up in readiness, and all hands except the
engineers were there, too.</p>

<p>All this time the only thought in every man&#8217;s mind
had been to save the ship; actually, no one imagined
that the fine vessel would presently make a final plunge
and disappear. Tryon had, indeed, signalled to the
other ships not to send the boats which were being
lowered. Having received the report that it was
thought the <i>Victoria</i> could keep afloat some time, Tryon
consented to her being steered for land. But the helm
refused to work.</p>

<p>The admiral now signalled: &#8220;Keep boats in readiness;
but do not send them.&#8221; And then, turning to an
officer, said: &#8220;It is my fault&mdash;entirely my fault!&#8221;</p>

<p>The seriousness of the position was now breaking
upon him, though even then he did not realise how near
the end was. The crew worked hard but orderly, hoisting
out the boats, or doing whatever they were told,
while down below the engineers and stokers kept at their
posts, albeit they knew that they stood little chance if
the ship dived beneath the surface.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Presently the men were drawn up on deck, four deep,
calm, cool, facing death without a tremor or sign of
panic, which would have been calamitous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, men, steady!&#8221; cried the chaplain, the
Rev. Samuel Morris; and steady they were, till Tryon,
seeing that all hope was gone, signalled for boats to be
sent, and gave orders for every man to look after himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump, men, jump!&#8221; was the command; and they
rushed to the side, ready to fling themselves overboard.
As they did so the great ship turned turtle, and men
went tumbling head first into the sea, down the bottom
of the ship as she dived, her port screw racing through
the air.</p>

<p>The scene that followed beggars description; but the
following extract is from a letter written to the <i>Times</i> by
a midshipman who was on one of the other ships. He
was sent off in a boat to rescue the struggling men in
the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_216.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;It was simply agonising to watch the wretched men struggling over the
ship&#8217;s bottom in masses&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could see all the men jumping overboard,&#8221; he
wrote. &#8220;She continued heeling over, and it was simply
agonising to watch the wretched men struggling out of
the ports over the ship&#8217;s bottom in masses. All this, of
course, happened in less time than it takes to write. You
could see the poor men who, in their hurry to jump over,
jumped on to the screw being cut to pieces as it revolved.
She heeled right over, the water rushing in
through her funnels. A great explosion of steam rose;
she turned right over, and you could see all the men
eagerly endeavouring to crawl over her bottom, when,
with a plunge, she went down bows first. We could
see her stern rise right out of the water and plunge down,
the screws still revolving. It was simply a dreadful
sight. We could not realise it. Personally, I was away
in my boat, pulling as hard as we could to the scene
of the disaster.... After pulling up and down for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
hours, we reorganised the fleet, leaving two ships on the
scene of the disaster; and, making for Tripoli, anchored
for the night. No one can realise the dreadful nature of
the accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, dropping the <i>Victoria</i> for a minute, we
must turn to the <i>Camperdown</i>. She appeared to be in a
very bad way. Her bow was sinking gradually, and I
must say at the time I thought it quite on the cards
that she might be lost also; but, thanks to the indomitable
way in which the crew worked, they managed
to check the inrush by means of the collision mat and
water-tight doors. All last night, however, they were
working hard to keep her afloat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can imagine our feelings&mdash;the flagship sunk
with nearly all hands, the other flagship anchored in a
sinking condition. We have a lot of the survivors of
the <i>Victoria</i> on board, but their accounts vary greatly....
Anyhow, what is quite certain is that the admiral
did not realise the gravity of his situation, or else he
would have abandoned the ship at once, instead of trying
to save her. The discipline was magnificent. Not
until the order was given did a single man jump overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last thing that was seen was the admiral refusing
to try to save himself, whilst his coxswain was
entreating him to go. Another instance of pluck was
exhibited by the boatswain of signals, who was making
a general semaphore until the water washed him away.
Unfortunately the poor chap was drowned. Many of the
survivors are in a dreadful state of mental prostration.
Most people say that Admiral Markham should have refused
to obey the signal, but I think that Admiral Tryon
infused so much awe in most of the captains of the fleet
that few would have disobeyed him. However, he stuck
to his ship to the last, and went down in her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Thus was the <i>Victoria</i> lost; less than a quarter of an
hour after being struck she was lying at the bottom of
the Mediterranean, Admiral Tryon and 400 gallant
seamen going with her.</p>

<p>At the court-martial Captain Bourke was absolved of
all blame for the loss of the ship, the finding being that
the disaster was entirely due to Admiral Tryon&#8217;s order
to turn the two lines sixteen points inward when they
were only six cables apart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INCIDENTS IN THE SLAVE TRADE</h2>


<p class="ph1">Stories of the Traffic in Human Merchandise</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE shall not here deal with the history and
abolition of slavery, because every schoolboy
knows all about that, and will doubtless be glad to
have something more exciting. And of excitement
there is abundance in the annals of slavery. The trade
was always attended by risks, even before the days
when it was illegal to ship slaves, for there was ever
the danger of the negroes breaking loose and running
amok on the ship; or, what was perhaps worse, the
holds of the slavers were often little less than death-holes,
with fever and cholera rampant. Altogether, it
was a game with big profits&mdash;and mighty big risks, as
the following story will show:</p>

<p>It was back in 1769 that the slaver <i>Delight</i> (Captain
Millroy) was the scene of an uprising of negroes, which
resulted in a rousing fight and fatal effects to a good
many aboard.</p>

<p>About three o&#8217;clock one Sunday morning Surgeon
Boulton and the men with him in the aft-cabin were
awakened by a chorus of screams and shrieks overhead,
a rushing of feet, a pandemonium of noise which told
that something serious was afoot. Boulton slipped out
of his bunk and dashed towards the captain&#8217;s cabin,
half guessing what was taking place. He reached the
cabin, and, entering, shook Millroy fiercely to awaken
him. He had barely succeeded in rousing the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
when a billet of wood came hurtling through the air
and caught him on the shoulder, and a cutlass pierced
his neck. Turning, Boulton saw that a couple of
negroes had, all unseen and unheard, crept below,
intent on putting the captain <i>hors de combat</i> while
he was asleep; and, finding the surgeon interfering with
their plot, they attacked him in quick time. Millroy,
now properly aroused, joined forces with Boulton, who
forgot his own danger in the thought of what was
happening above, and the pair chased the negroes on
to the deck, Boulton carrying a pistol and the captain
a cutlass.</p>

<p>When they reached deck they found themselves in
a very inferno. Hundreds of negroes were swarming
all over the place, some armed with wooden spars,
others with cutlasses; and with these weapons they were
hard at it taking vengeance on their captors. The
herd of savages flung themselves upon the seamen,
cutting off legs and arms, mutilating bodies dreadfully,
their yells making the air ring. Boulton and the captain,
realising that it was a case for prompt and vigorous
action, hurled themselves into the heaving fight
with a will. Down went one negro, killed by Millroy&#8217;s
cutlass; then another; while Boulton did all he could.
But the &#8220;all&#8221; of these two men was but little, and presently
Millroy fell to the deck, overpowered by numbers,
and literally hacked to pieces. Boulton, more fortunate,
escaped injury, and made a dash for the rigging, up
which he scrambled till he came to the maintop, where
he discovered the cook and a boy had already taken
refuge.</p>

<p>Perched on their lofty platform, the three looked
down upon deck, watching as though fascinated the
drama being enacted before their eyes, seeing the now
maddened negroes wreaking vengeance on the men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
were bearing them from freedom to slavery. The bloodlust
was upon them, and they searched the ship to take
their fill.</p>

<p>Suddenly the watchers saw two men come up from
below and make a rush across the deck to the rigging.
Like lightning the negroes dashed after them, and one
man was brought to deck by a dozen billets flung at
him, and his body was cut to pieces. The second man,
more fortunate, managed to reach the rigging, and
clambered up like a monkey.</p>

<p>The negroes, having satisfied themselves that they
had accounted for all the crew with the exception of
those in the maintop, whom they decided to deal with
presently, ransacked the ship, seeking arms; and meanwhile
Boulton, knowing that safety depended upon
weapons, went on a tour of exploration. He wormed
his way into the foretop to see what might be there,
and luckily found a knife, with which he set out to
return to the maintop. On the way the negroes saw
him, and began to pelt him with billets of wood, all
of which missed, however; so that Boulton reached his
comrades safely. The one dread in the minds of the
four survivors was that the negroes would find the
arms-chest, in which case it seemed to them hopeless
to expect to escape. While the slaves remained armed
only with wooden spars and cutlasses, Boulton did not
feel particularly anxious, knowing that he and his companions
would be able to tackle any who dared to
ascend the rigging to try and get them down. One
thing that kept him hopeful was the fact that another
slaver, the <i>Apollo</i>, was almost within hailing distance,
and the <i>Delight</i>, unsteered and sails untrimmed, was
rapidly drifting towards her, which would make the
men on the <i>Apollo</i> aware that something had happened.
But Boulton&#8217;s luck was out. The negroes found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
arms-chest, and, breaking it open, armed themselves
with muskets, and set to work in earnest to put the
survivors out of action.</p>

<p>Shot after shot sang by the maintop, and one of
the men there, fearing that he would be killed if he
stayed, and might be saved if he trusted himself to the
mercy of the negroes, like a madman descended to the
deck. Barely had his foot touched it when a negro
fell upon him with an axe and split his head in two;
and a dozen pairs of hands seized him and pitched him
overboard to the sharks which were following the ship,
their appetites whetted by the feasts already given them
by the negroes.</p>

<p>While this was going on, other slaves were still
shooting away at the maintop, fruitlessly; and Boulton
was calling madly on the <i>Apollo</i>, now not far away.
Presently the captain of the other vessel, realising what
was afoot, gave the word, and a broadside hurtled across
the deck of the <i>Delight</i>, in the hope of frightening the
slaves. They seemed to take little notice of this, however,
and Boulton began to fear that all was over,
especially as the negroes, seeing that they could not
hit the men in the maintop, ceased fire, and a giant
black, cutlass in one hand and a pistol in the other,
sprang into the rigging, bent, apparently, on storming
the position. Boulton waited calmly. He had no
weapons but his knife and a quart bottle; but he felt
that he was in a good position to meet an attack. Presently
the negro&#8217;s head appeared above the platform,
and then&mdash;<i>whack!</i> The bottle fell upon it with a
sickening thud, the black lost his hold, and went
hurtling into the sea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Apollo</i> was firing at the <i>Delight</i>,
and the latter was returning the fire as well as it could,
the negroes evidently knowing that to give in was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
court disaster, and to lose what they had stood in a
fair way to gaining. For four hours they fought the
<i>Apollo</i>, and at the same time kept up their fusillade on
the maintop.</p>

<p>Then came the end. Not because the negroes were
not able to keep up any longer, but because a shot
from the <i>Apollo</i> fell into a barrel of gunpowder and
exploded it, with the result that the <i>Delight</i> took fire,
and the slaves could not cope with the flames and their
enemy at the same time. The revolt fizzled out as
quickly as it had arisen. While the negroes rushed
about seeking to put out the fire, Boulton, taking
his life in his hands, descended to the deck, at the
same time that a boat set out from the <i>Apollo</i> with
a crew to tackle the flames and the negroes, who,
filled with consternation, now stood quietly by watching
the fire-fighters. They were absolutely cowed;
they had made their bid for freedom, and had failed,
and they knew it. They allowed themselves to be
driven below and secured. The result of their revolt
was that nine of the crew of the <i>Delight</i> were butchered,
one man on the <i>Apollo</i> was killed, and eighteen of the
negroes found death instead of liberty&mdash;perhaps death
to them was better than freedom; certainly better than
the lot of those poor human cattle they left behind them.</p>

<p>Such incidents as this were of frequent occurrence,
and the recital of one must suffice.</p>

<p>After the Abolition Act had been passed, severe
measures were brought into operation, giving the Navy
a wide scope&mdash;so wide that, even although a vessel had
no slaves on board, yet, if the naval officers had reason
to suspect that slaving was her business, they could
apprehend her. Special ships were fitted out and commissioned
to deal with the traffic in the South Atlantic,
both off Central America and the West Coast of Africa.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
So effective were the measures taken that the slavers
resorted to all manner of disguises to turn suspicion
away from their vessels, which had hitherto been of a
distinctive kind&mdash;long, rakish craft with tall spars, the
whole effect being one of beauty, and the idea being
speed. The traders changed all this by having ships
more after the fashion of the ordinary merchant vessel,
so that the hunters had a more difficult task in front of
them. But they worked energetically, and swept the
seas month after month, on the look-out for the human
cattle-ships, and, as all the world knows, succeeded in
clearing them from the seas.</p>

<p>The subjoined account from the Sierra Leone
<i>Watchman</i> for November 15, 1846, gives a striking
picture of the conditions against which the Navy were
doing such good work.</p>

<p>The vessel referred to is the Brazilian brigantine
<i>Paqueta de Rio</i>, captured off Sherbro:</p>

<p>&#8220;The 547 human beings&mdash;besides the crew and
passengers (as they styled themselves), twenty-eight in
number&mdash;were stowed in a vessel of 74 tons. The slaves
were all stowed together, perfectly naked, with nothing
on which to rest but the surfaces of the water-casks.
These were made level by filling in billets of wood, and
formed the slave-deck. The slaves who were confined in
the hold&mdash;it being utterly impossible for the whole of
them to remain on deck at one time&mdash;were in a profuse
perspiration, and panting like so many hounds for water.
The smell on board was dreadful. I was informed that,
on the officers of the <i>Cygnet</i> boarding the slaver, the
greater part of the slaves were chained together with
pieces of chain, which were passed through iron collars
round their necks; iron shackles were also secured round
their legs and arms. After the officers had boarded,
and the slaves were made to understand they were free,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
their acclamations were long and loud. They set to
work, and, with the billets of wood which had hitherto
formed their bed, knocked off each other&#8217;s shackles,
and threw most of them overboard. There were several
left, which were shown to me. We will leave it to the
imagination of your readers what must have been the
feelings of these poor people when they found they were
again free&mdash;free through the energy and activity of a
British cruiser. On examining the poor creatures, who
were principally of the Kosso nation, I found they
belonged to, and were shipped to, different individuals;
they were branded like sheep. Letters were burnt in
the skin two inches in length. Many of them, from
the recent period it had been done, were in a state of
ulceration. Both males and females were marked as
follows: On the right breast &#8216;J&#8217;; on the left arm,
&#8216;P&#8217;; over women&#8217;s right and left breasts, &#8216;S&#8217; and
&#8216;A&#8217;; under the left shoulder, &#8216;P&#8217;; right breast, &#8216;R&#8217;
and &#8216;RJ&#8217;; on the right and left breasts, &#8216;SS&#8217;; and
on the right and left shoulder, &#8216;SS.&#8217; This is the
same vessel that cleared out from here about three
weeks previous to her capture for Rio de Janeiro. The
slaves were all embarked from the slave factories at
Gallinas, under the notorious Don Luiz, and the vessel
under way in five hours; and had there been the
slightest breeze she would have escaped. Among the
slaves there were two men belonging to Sierra Leone&mdash;a
man named Peter, once employed by Mr. Elliott, the
pilot. He stated that he had been employed by a
Mr. Smith, a Popohman, to go to Sherbro to purchase
palm-oil, and that whilst pursuing that object he was
seized and sold by a Sherbro chief named Sherry.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A RACE TO SUCCOUR</h2>


<p class="ph1">An Incident of the United States Revenue Service</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE records of the revenue men of the United
States teem with heroic deeds done in the execution
of their duty. The present story is typical of the
thrilling determination of men who will not be beaten,
and incidentally shows a healthy rivalry between the
revenue men and the lifeboatmen.</p>

<p>On January 11, 1891, the three-masted schooner
<i>Ada Barker</i> encountered a terrific storm which played
shuttlecock with her, and after a fierce conflict pitched
her on to the Junk of Pork, the euphonious name of a
large rock near outer Green Island, off the coast of
Maine. The Junk of Pork rises a sheer fifty feet out
of the water, and all round it are reefs and boulders,
a literal death-trap to any unfortunate vessel that should
get caught there. The <i>Ada Barker</i>, after having her
sails torn to shreds and her rigging hopelessly entangled,
began to ship water, and though her men
worked hard and long at the pumps, they could not
save her; then she was bowled on to the outer reef at
night; the bottom dropped out of her, and she heeled
over. To the men on board it seemed that the
end of all things had come, and they gave themselves
up for lost.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_226.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Though her men worked hard and long at the pumps, they could not save
her&#8221;</p>

<p>As the ship heeled they heard the sound of something
striking against a rock; then again, as the ship
rebounded and fell forward once more. Eager to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the most slender chance of life, they scrambled to the
side, and saw that the mast was hitting against the
Junk of Pork.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys!&#8221; cried the captain. &#8220;That&#8217;s our one
chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors knew what he meant. They had looked
about them. To jump into that boiling surf was to
leap into the jaws of death; they would be smashed to
pulp, or drowned like rats. They saw now, however,
that the rock before them could be reached by scrambling
up the mast, which was crashing against it. But
they must hurry; and hurry they did. Like monkeys
they swarmed up the mast, caring nothing for torn
hands nor the flapping canvas, which slashed them like
whipcords and threatened to knock them off into the
cauldron below. They fought their elemental fight, and
one by one six men dropped on to the Junk of Pork;
and for hours and hours they clung to their precarious
perch, buffeted by strong winds, swamped by heavy
seas and crouching in terror as a mountain wave reared
its head and, as if angry that the men had escaped,
broke upon them with a thunderous roar. At other
times they were flung headlong on the rock by a gust
of wind which howled at them as if seeking to drown
their voices as they yelled for help, in the hope that
some ship might be near and hear them through the
noise of the gale.</p>

<p>All through the long, dreadful night they remained
thus, glad to have found even so bleak a haven, but
wondering whether, after all, they would be rescued.
Then their eyes were gladdened by the sight of a ship
away out on the horizon. Rising and falling as the
still boisterous seas kept up their see-saw motion, she
was coming in their direction. Would she see them?
They knew that at the distance the ship was away they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
could not be visible yet; yet, cold, drenched to the
skin, almost exhausted by exposure, they stripped themselves
of their shirts and waved&mdash;waved like madmen,
fearing they would be passed by. Had they but known
it, the officer of the watch of the coming boat&mdash;the
United States revenue cutter, of Woodbury&mdash;thought
he could see dark forms on the flat top of the storm-wracked
Junk of Pork in a state of frantic activity.
Levelling his glasses, he soon saw the forms of the six
men waving the torn and tattered shirts; and he knew
that some ship had been wrecked during the storm
which the <i>Woodbury</i> herself had encountered and fought
sternly against for hours on end since she left Portland.</p>

<p>It took but a few moments for everyone on the cutter
to be made aware of the position of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make her, boys&#8221; said Captain Fengar, who
was in command. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have those chaps off the
Junk of Pork!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; was the chorus; and, with engines
pounding out every ounce of steam, the cutter pushed
her nose through the water, fighting hard against the
storm, which was raging as fiercely as ever. Nearer
and nearer they drove, whistling anon to encourage the
stranded mariners, who, weary and exhausted, cried for
very joy as they realised that they had been seen and
that help was coming. Help was coming! Their
madness of anxiety gave way to a delirium of joy. Then
their hearts sank into an abyss of despair.</p>

<p>The cutter was very near to them now, but the sea
was too rough for her to venture close to the rocks;
the reefs were one cauldron of boiling surf, and the
stranded men knew that no boat from the cutter could
hope to live in such a sea, or hope to escape destruction
on the reefs if she ventured near.</p>

<p>Help had come&mdash;and had proved helpless!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>They threw themselves down upon the rock and
clutched at the bare surface. They were frenzied. They
wondered how much longer they could withstand the
gnawings of hunger, the agonies of thirst; how much
longer, too, they could retain enough strength to keep
their footing on the rock-top. They even thought of
leaving their precious haven and trying to reach the
wreck of their once proud little ship, where there was
indeed food and water. But second thoughts showed
them that certain death lay that way, while there was
hope that the cutter might be able to get to them.
They saw that she was hovering about, cruising here
and there to keep headway with the storm, her whistle
shrieking out encouragement, and letting them know
that she was standing by, in the hope that the storm
would abate and enable them to launch their boats.</p>

<p>Night came, but the gale still raged, and Captain
Fengar decided that there was only one way to bring
about the rescue he was determined to effect, and that
was to put back to Portland and bring dories with which
to land on the rock at dawn next day. He could not
hope to do much good during the night, even if the
storm eased off somewhat; the danger of the breakers
was too great. So, whistling across to the wretched
men on the rock, he let them know that he was going
away, but would come back, and then save them.</p>

<p>The first shock of realising that they were to be
left alone again wellnigh crazed the men; they felt that
they would prefer to wait there for death with company
than wait alone for salvation. But away went the cutter,
whistling as she went in answer to the wavings of the
sailors; and as the final scream died away the men
sank down upon the rock in desolation of despair, with
nothing but the howling of the wind and the roar of
the breakers to keep them company.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The cutter sped through the night, passing Cape
Elizabeth on her way, and giving the bearings of the
wreck to the lifeboat station there. Reaching Portland,
she took her dories and raced back to the Junk of Pork,
arriving there an hour after daybreak. The feelings
of the now almost dead mariners may be better imagined
than described when they heard the siren of the cutter
calling to them, telling them of the coming of hope and
help. They forgot the raging storm, for they knew
that these men who had come back had brought the
wherewithal to save them.</p>

<p>On the cutter the revenue men were busy preparing
to launch the boats and the small white cutter, when
the lifeboat from Cape Elizabeth hove in sight. The
very sight of her acted as an additional spur to them,
for they regarded this little matter as particularly their
own, and although they themselves had warned the
lifeboatman of the wreck they felt that it was their
duty to effect the rescue. They vowed to themselves
that they would get the men off the rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; cried Captain Fengar, &#8220;we want to
get those men off ourselves! Hustle!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they hustled. In the twinkling of an eye as it
seemed a couple of boats were lowered and the men
were in their places.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not fail,&#8221; said Fengar as they pushed
off. &#8220;God bless you!&#8221; And away they went towards
the boiling surf, beneath which they knew lurked
hideous, treacherous rocks. Lieutenant Howland, an
old whaler, had charge of the first boat, and with him
went Third Lieutenant Scott and Cadet Van Cott, who
had entreated the captain to allow him to go. Seamen
Haskell and Gross manned the second boat. Like
madmen the Woodbury men pulled, straining every effort
to win in the race they had set themselves, knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
that the Cape Elizabeth lifeboat was sweeping through
the seas towards the rock. As for the lifeboat, its crew
were tired, weary with much fighting of the storm. But
they were game; they realised what the Woodbury men
were intent on doing, and they themselves determined
to do their best to beat them in this race for the lives
of six unfortunate men. It was surely one of the
queerest contests ever engaged in, and at the back of it
was but one idea&mdash;to win through to the rock and get
the stranded mariners to safety.</p>

<p>The first honours went to the Woodbury men; the
dory manned by Haskell and Gross got there ahead of
all; they swept through a narrow channel between the
reefs, were wellnigh battered to pieces against the foot
of the Junk of Pork, hailed the men on top&mdash;as though
they needed hailing!&mdash;and the next instant a man
leaped clear of the rock and tumbled into the dory,
which pitched and rolled dangerously at the impact.
Then, realising that they could not stay there any
longer, Haskell and Gross turned their dory about and
made for the channel again; careful steering took her
safely through, and then, buffeted by the waves, they
pulled feverishly towards the cutter, where they eventually
got their man safely aboard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Howland was keeping his men at it; the
race now lay between him and the lifeboat, and he meant
to win. With shouts and heave-ho&#8217;s, Howland urged
his men on; and on they went, while across the waters
came the shouts of the lifeboatmen as they bent lustily
to their task.</p>

<p>The revenue boat won by a neck! With a thud she
hit the breakers just ahead of the lifeboat, shivered, and
then, lifted up by a giant comber, cleared a submerged
reef, delved on the other side, and came up almost filled
with water. Shaking herself as a dog shakes the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
from his coat, she righted, and Lieutenant Scott leaped
boldly into the surf; but as he did so the undertow took
the boat and, as he still had hold of her, dragged him
under water. For a moment his comrades thought him
gone, but presently he came up, almost frozen, but still
hanging on to the boat. And the next moment a roller
caught the boat and pitched her on to a slice of rock.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously the lifeboat plunged at the
breakers. For a second she hesitated. Her men were
debating whether they should shoot clear or land. They
saw the revenue men land. Where they could go, there
could the men of Cape Elizabeth; and they put the nose
of their boat at it, heading straight for the rocks. Less
fortunate than the others, the lifeboat banged into a
mighty rock, which stove in her bow and rendered her
unmanageable.</p>

<p>Instantly the winners of the strange race saw that the
lifeboat was helpless and in danger; the men on the
Junk of Pork could wait; they were safe! The revenue
men plunged into the surf, waded and swam to the lifeboat,
seized hold of her, and dragged her on to the
strip of rock. It was all done as in a flash; hesitation
would have meant disaster. But it was done, and
the rivals stood together at the foot of the Junk of
Pork. Then, resting awhile from their herculean
labours, they set about the rescue of the stranded
mariners, who were very soon in the revenue boat, and
being rowed across to the Woodbury cutter, which, when
all was done, steamed back to Portland, after forty hours
of hard fighting for the rescue of half a dozen men;
forty hours well spent, too.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A TRAGEDY OF THE SOUTH POLE</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Thrilling Story of Scott&#8217;s Expedition to the Antarctic</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE age-old dreams of hundreds of men have been
realised; the ends of the earth have yielded up
their secrets&mdash;the Poles have been discovered. Peary
to the North, Amundsen and Scott to the South, hardy
adventurers all, with the wanderlust in their souls and
science as their beckoner&mdash;these men went forth and
wrested from the ice-bound regions something of what
had been refused to the scores of men preceding them;
some of whom had come back, weak, despondent, while
others left their bones as silent witnesses to their noble
failure to achieve what they set out for.</p>

<p>Of all the many expeditions which have set forth to
the Polar regions, none was more tragic than that
commanded by Captain Robert F. Scott. In practically
the hour of his triumph he failed, because, no matter
how efficient an organisation, no matter how far-sighted
policy and arrangements may be, there is always the
uncertain human element; there comes the point when
human endurance can stand out no longer, when the
struggle against the titan forces of Nature cannot be
kept up. And then there is failure, though often a
splendid failure.</p>

<p>Such was that of Captain Scott; he reached the goal
he had aimed at for many years only to find that he
had been forestalled by a month, and then, overtaken
by unexpected bad weather, he and the men with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
had to give up the struggle when within eleven miles of
just one thing they stood in need of&mdash;fuel with which
to cook the hot meals that meant life. The story is one
that makes the blood course through the veins, makes
the heart glow, makes the head bow in honour; because
it is a story of matchless bravery, heroic fortitude
and noble effort.</p>

<p>The <i>Terra Nova</i>, Scott&#8217;s ship, carried a complement
of sixty men, each one of them picked because of his
efficiency, each one having his allotted work. Geologists
and grooms, physicist and photographers, meteorologists
and motor-engineer, surgeons and ski-expert and
seamen, men to care for dogs, and men to cook food&mdash;a
civilised community of efficient, well-found, keen,
and high-idealed men. It was, in fact, the best-equipped
Polar expedition ever sent forth. Scott went out not
merely to discover the South Pole, but also to gather
data that should elucidate many problems of science.
He took with him all the apparatus that would be
necessary for this purpose, and when the <i>Terra Nova</i>
left New Zealand, on November 26, 1910, there seemed
good reason for the conviction that success must attend
the expedition.</p>

<p>The voyage out to the Polar Sea was uneventful,
except that early in December a great storm arose,
and called for good seamanship to keep the vessel
going; and even then she was very badly knocked
about. She made a good deal of water, and the seamen
had to pump hard and long; but at last, under steam
and sail, the <i>Terra Nova</i> came through safely, and was
able to go forward again, and by December 9 was in
the ice-pack, which was that year much farther north
than was expected. This held them up so that they could
not go in the direction they wanted to, and had to drift
where the pack would take them&mdash;northwards. Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Day found them still in the pack, and they celebrated
the festivity in the good old English style. By
the 30th they were out of the pack, and set off for Cape
Crozier, the end of the Great Ice Barrier, where they had
decided to fix their winter quarters. They could not get
there, however, and they had to proceed to Cape Royds,
passing along an ice-clad coast which showed no likely
landing-place. Cape Royds was also inaccessible owing
to the ice, and the ship was worked to the Skuary Cape,
renamed Cape Evans, in the McMurdo Sound.</p>

<p>A landing was effected, and for a week the explorers
worked like niggers getting stores ashore, disembarking
ponies and dogs, unloading sledges, and the hundred
and one other things necessary to success. The hut,
which was brought over in pieces, was also taken ashore,
a suitable site for it cleared, and the carpenters began
erecting it.</p>

<p>During these early days misfortune fell upon them.
One of their three motor-sledges, upon which great
hopes were built, slipped through the ice and was lost.</p>

<p>By January 14 the station was almost finished, and
Captain Scott went on a sledge trip to Hut Point, some
miles to the west. Here Scott had wintered on his
first expedition, which set out from England in 1901.
In this his new expedition the hut was to be used for
some of the party, and telephonic communication was
installed. In due course the station was completed;
there is no need for us to go into all the details of the
hard work, or the exercising of animals and men, but a
short description of this house on the ice may be of
interest. It was a wooden structure, 50 feet long by
25 feet wide and nine feet to the eaves. It was divided
into officers&#8217; and men&#8217;s quarters; there was a laboratory
and dark-room, galley and workshop. Books were
there, pictures on the walls, stove to keep the right temperature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Stables were built on the north side, and a
store-room on the south. In the hut itself was a pianola
and a gramophone to wile away the monotony
of the long winter night. Mr. Ponting, the camera
artist, had a lantern with him, which was to provide
vast entertainment in the way of picture-lectures on all
kinds of subjects. Altogether, everything was as compact
and comfortable as could be wished.</p>

<p>Naturally, there were various adventures during
these early days; once the ship just managed to get
away from the spot where almost immediately afterwards
a huge berg crashed down, only a little later on
the same day to become stranded. Luckily, by much
hard work, the seamen managed to get her off.</p>

<p>On January 25 the next piece of work was begun&mdash;namely,
the laying of a depot some hundred miles towards
the south. Both ponies and dogs were used for
this work, which took nearly a month&mdash;the Barrier ice
was always dangerous&mdash;and both the outward and inward
journeys were beset by bad weather, bad surfaces,
hard work, disappointments and many dangers. Once,
a party was lost, and found only after they had experienced
much suffering.</p>

<p>It was not until April 13 that the depot laying party
returned to the hut, minus some of their animals, which
had succumbed to the rigours of the climate and the
stiff work demanded of them. A few days later the
long winter night set in, and the men had to confine
themselves to winter quarters to wait until the coming
of the sun before the main object of their voyage could
be attempted. The ship had returned to New Zealand
meanwhile.</p>

<p>The long winter months were filled up with scientific
studies of the neighbourhood, and evenings were
occasions for lantern lectures and discussions on all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
kinds of subjects, including those which concerned the
expedition. There was plenty of work to do; things
had to be prepared, as far as was possible then, for the
final dash; the animals had to be looked after; and they
were a source of trouble, because it was essential that
they should be kept fit. A winter party was organised
and sent to Cape Crozier, a journey that took them
five weeks under &#8220;the hardest conditions on record.&#8221; It
was well worth while, for many were the valuable observations
made.</p>

<p>Always the scientific aspect of the expedition was
kept in view; and when the sun returned a spring journey
to the west was undertaken, Scott and his little party
being absent thirteen days, 175 miles being covered in
that time.</p>

<p>We now come to the great journey to the Pole&mdash;a
journey of 800 miles. On October 24 the two motor-sledges
were sent off, after a good deal of trouble, Evans
and Day in charge of one, and Lashly of the other;
they were the forerunners of the expedition to the Pole.
On the 26th, Hut Point rang up to say that the motors
were in trouble, and Scott and seven men went off to
see what they could do. They came up with the motors
about three miles from Hut Point, and found that
various little things were causing trouble. Eventually,
these difficulties were overcome, and the sledges started
off again, and Scott and his party went back to Cape
Evans to get ready for their own journey south.</p>

<p>&#8220;The future is in the lap of the gods; I can think
of nothing left undone to deserve success.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus wrote Captain Scott the night before he set
out on his last great journey, and reading the remarkable
journal which he left, one is forced to the conclusion
that he was right; if ever man deserved success, if ever
achievement with glory and safety should have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
vouchsafed, it should have been to Scott; but the lap of
the gods is often a sacrificial altar on which men lay
down their lives for the sake of great ideals.</p>

<p>It was on November 1 that the Southern Party set
out. It consisted of ten men, in charge of ten ponies
drawing sledges, and two men leading the dogs which
were to take the ponies&#8217; places when the latter were
done. Everything was favourable for the send-off, and
the company arrived at Hut Point, the first stoppage
place, quite safely. From there they pushed on again
in three parties, the slowest starting first, and the others
following at sufficient intervals for all to arrive at the
end of the day&#8217;s stage at the same time. The motor
party going on in front were putting up cairns for
guidance, and Scott himself on the journey to One Ton
Depot had placed landmarks to guide them. On the
4th Scott came across the wreck of the sledge worked by
Captain Evans and Day&mdash;a cylinder had gone wrong,
and the motor had had to be abandoned, the men going
on with the other sledge. This was the first bit of ill-luck,
but the days to come were to bring much more.
The dash to One Ton Depot consisted of hard going over
rough surfaces; there were blizzards, trouble with the
ponies; snow walls had to be built to protect the animals
at camp after a long and hard night&#8217;s toil, during which
they had journeyed seldom more than ten miles. Night
was chosen because it enabled them to escape the sun,
which even in that latitude was sufficient to make them
sweat as they forced their way over the terrible ground.
They reached One Ton Depot at last, and then
picked up the motor party, commanded by Evans, on
November 21. The motorists had been waiting six
days, unable to go any farther.</p>

<p>The little band now plunged forward again, meeting
the same difficult surface, having the same trouble with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
the ponies, one of whom had to be shot on the 24th, the
day on which the first supporting party, consisting of
Day and Hooper, were sent back to the base. Two days
later a depot was laid, Middle Barrier Depot, and on
the 28th, when ninety miles from the Glacier, another
pony was shot, and provided food for the dogs. Ninety
miles were still to be covered, and there was only food
for seven marches for the animals. It would be stiff
going, for Scott was relying upon the ponies getting
him to the foot of the Glacier.</p>

<p>Having laid another depot on December 1, thus
lightening the load, and hoping to be able to make good
progress, they were furiously opposed by the elements.
On the 3rd, the 4th, and the 5th, blizzards blew down
upon them, impeding them, making the work trebly
difficult, and the last one holding them up for four days,
during which food, precious food, and much-needed
fuel were being consumed without any progress being
made. Impatient, bitterly cold, with the animals getting
worn out, Scott and his companions had to keep to
their tents, eager to go on, but realising that to venture
forth was to court disaster. Experienced Polar explorer
though he was, Scott was at a loss to account for the
character of the weather at this, the most favourable,
only practicable, time of the year. It was disheartening,
especially when they had to start on the rations that
they had reckoned would not be needed until they
reached the summit of the Glacier. But at last the
blizzard blew itself out, and, stiff and cold, the party set
out again, each day finding their ponies becoming
weaker, until on the 9th, at Camp 31, named the
Shambles, all these were shot.</p>

<p>Then it was a case of the dogs pulling the sledges,
and on the 10th the explorers began the ascent of the
Beardmore Glacier, the summit of which was thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
of feet above them. Meares and Atkinson left for the
base on the 11th, and the reduced party trudged forward
and upwards, now having to go down again to avoid
some dangerous part, toiling manfully up the Glacier, in
danger of falling into crevasses, sinking into soft snow,
which made the surface so difficult that after trudging for
hours and hours only four miles were covered when
they had hoped to do ten or more. By the 22nd, when
the next supporting party left, they had climbed 7,100
feet (the day before they had been up 8,000 feet) and then
a heavy mist enshrouded them, and hung them up for
some hours&mdash;when every minute was precious.</p>

<p>When they started on the 22nd there were but eight
men, and these toiled on day after day, meeting all
sorts of trouble, running all kinds of risks, but never
stopping unless compelled, dropping a depot on the last
day of the year, and sending back three men on the
4th. This left only Scott, Captain Oates, Petty Officer
Evans, Dr. Wilson and Lieutenant Bowers to make the
final dash to the Pole. They had over a month&#8217;s rations,
which was considered ample to do the 150 miles that
separated them from their goal.</p>

<p>The party now had the small ten-foot sledges, which
were neat and compact, and much lighter than the
twelve-foot sledges which were sent back. The dogs
had now gone back, and all the pulling was done by the
men. The difficulty of the surface made them leave their
skis behind on the 7th, but later on that day the surface
become so much easier that it was decided to go back
for the skis, which delayed them nearly an hour and a
half. They were now on the summit, and were held up
by a blizzard which, though it delayed them, gave them
the opportunity for a rest which they sadly needed,
especially Evans, who had hurt his hand badly while
attending to the sledges. On the 9th they were able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
start again, now swinging out across the great Polar
plateau. They cached more stores on the 10th, and
found the lightening of the load very helpful. But even
then, so hard was the pulling, that on the 11th, when
only seventy-four miles from the Pole, Scott asked himself
whether they could keep up the struggle for another
seven days. Never had men worked so hard before at
so monotonous a task; winds blew upon them, clouds
worried them because they knew not what might come
in their wake; snow was falling and covering the track
behind them, sufficient to cause them some anxiety, for
they wanted that track to lead them home again via their
depots upon which safety depended.</p>

<p>The weather! Day by day the weather worried them;
only that could baulk them in their purpose, and never
men prayed so much for fine days as did these. The
16th found them still forcing their way onward, with
lightened loads again, having left a depot on the previous
day, consisting of four days&#8217; food; and they knew
that they were now only two good marches from the
Pole. Considering they carried with them nine days&#8217;
rations, while just behind lay another four days&#8217;, they
felt that all would be well if the weather would but keep
clear for them.</p>

<p>The thing that now troubled these men who toiled
so manfully against great odds was the thought that
lurked in their minds that when they reached the Pole
they might find that they had been forestalled. For they
knew, everyone of them, that the Norwegian, Amundsen,
was bent on achieving what they were hoping to do: on
being first at the Pole. They knew, too, that things had
been more favourable for him from the very outset; that
he had been able to set out from a much better spot than
they had. What if they attained the goal, only to find
a foreign flag flying bravely in the breeze? The thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
was maddening; but the Britishers were sportsmen. And
when months before Scott had heard that Amundsen
was in the South, instead of trying for the North Pole,
as he had given out when he started, the gallant captain
had made up his mind to act just as if he had no competitor.</p>

<p>Next day, the 16th, all their hopes were dashed to the
ground. Away out across the white expanse there
loomed a tiny black speck, and immediately Scott&#8217;s
thoughts flew to Amundsen. Some of his companions
said it was one thing, others another. As they pulled
hard at their loads the five men debated amongst themselves,
trying to cheer each other up, seeking to cast
aside the horrible thought that would force its way into
their minds.</p>

<p>And then, the black spot was reached. It was a
black flag, tied to a sledge bearer. It was the sign that
the Norwegians had won in the race.</p>

<p>All around were signs of a camp, which to the filmed
eyes of the explorers were the tokens of their failure to
be first.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a terrible disappointment,&#8221; wrote Scott in his
diary, &#8220;and I am very sorry for my loyal companions.
Many thoughts come and much discussion have we
had. To-morrow we must march on to the Pole, and
then hasten home with the utmost speed we can compass.
All the day dreams must go; it will be a
wearisome return.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the next day the Pole was reached, and from
out its solitude and austerity the great explorer cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Great God! This is an awful place, and terrible
enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward
of priority....&#8221;</p>

<p>The great goal had been won; but the joy of
achievement was dimmed; Amundsen&#8217;s records and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
tent were found there, the Norwegian flag had been
hoisted and flaunted bravely in the wind. They had
been forestalled by over a month.</p>

<p>Having fixed up their &#8220;poor slighted Union Jack,&#8221;
as Scott called it, the explorers turned northwards again,
and began to retrace their footsteps over the Polar
plateau, which had cost them so much labour to cross,
then down the great Glacier with ever worsening
weather. The men themselves, who had been so fit
coming out, were now beginning to show signs of their
gigantic labours; perhaps now, when the day dreams
were over, and hopes long deferred had been fulfilled
and dashed to pieces at one moment, they were disheartened;
there was not the spur of achievement before
them. Evans and Oates began to show signs of weariness&mdash;those
two strong men of the party. Evans had
his nose and fingers frostbitten and suffered much
agony. Then, while descending the Glacier, he tumbled
on the Glacier, fell among rough ice which injured his
head, and gave him a touch of concussion of the brain.
Dr. Wilson injured his leg, and snow-blindness was
causing him much trouble. All these things impeded
the party, to whom time was everything; food depended
on picking up the depots on the right days&mdash;perhaps
hours; and when, as often happened, the track was
not easily found, the anxiety of the explorers was considerably
increased.</p>

<p>Then Evans grew worse; from being self-reliant,
and the man on whom the party had been able to look
for help in any circumstances, he became weak and
wellnigh helpless; he lagged behind, and the party had
to wait for him to catch up. On February 17 at the
foot of the Glacier, after a terribly hard day&#8217;s work,
Evans&mdash;poor man!&mdash;was so far behind when the party
camped, that his comrades became anxious and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
back for him. They found him. The limit of
human endurance had been reached. &#8220;He was on his
knees, with clothing disarranged, hands uncovered and
frostbitten, and a wild look in his eyes.&#8221; They got
him to the tent with great difficulty, and he died that
night. Scott mourned his loss; and his journal is full
of his praises of the petty officer who had been so indefatigable
a worker and so adaptable a man, doing
everything his inventive genius could think of to lighten
the work for the explorers.</p>

<p>One day was now much like another to the four
men left; they pushed on and on, picking up depots as
they went, and suffering every day from the bitter cold,
and feeling the effects of the hard work. On March 16,
Captain Oates went out. Frostbitten hands and feet
had made life burdensome for him, and he knew that
he was a burden to the gallant men with him; without
him, they could progress much quicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on without me,&#8221; he had said, earlier in the day.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep in my sleeping bag!&#8221; But they had prevailed
upon him to keep on. Like a hero he forced
himself to struggle on until they camped at night.
When the morning came he awoke. Of him in those
last moments Scott said: &#8220;He was a brave soul.... It
was blowing a blizzard. He said: &#8216;I&#8217;m just going
outside, and may be some time.&#8217; He went out into the
blizzard, and we have not seen him since.... We
knew that poor Oates was walking to his death; but
though we tried to dissuade him, we knew it was the
act of a brave man and an English gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had sacrificed himself for the sake of the others.
&#8220;Greater love hath no man than this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reduced now to three men, the little party struggled
on gamely, fighting against the weariness that was upon
them, making with all haste for One Ton Depot. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
had expected ere this to have met the dogs which were
to come out to help them back, but misfortune had
overtaken Cherry Garrard, who had been waiting at One
Ton Depot for six days held up by a blizzard. He had
not sufficient food for the dogs to enable him to go
south, and he knew that the state of the weather might
easily make him miss Scott, whereas to wait at the depot
was to be on hand when Scott did turn up.</p>

<p>Now the dire peril of their position forced itself
upon them; though they fought to drive the thoughts
away, manfully cheering each other up, none of them
believed that they would ever get through, and on
March 18, when twenty-one miles from the depot, the
wind compelled them to call a halt. Scott&#8217;s right foot
was frostbitten; he suffered from indigestion; they had
only a half fill of oil left and a small amount of spirit.
It meant that when this was gone, they could have no
more hot drink&mdash;which would bring the end.</p>

<p>Despite their sufferings they went on again, until on
the 21st they were camped eleven miles from the depot,
a blizzard raging round them, little food, no fuel, and
knowing in their hearts that when the next day dawned
they could not continue the journey perilous and
laborious; the end was at hand.</p>

<p>Days before Scott and Bowers had made Dr. Wilson
give them that which would enable them to put an end
to their misery; but now to-night, when face to face
with death, they resolved that they would die natural
deaths; it should not be said of them that they shirked.
Each morning until the 29th they got ready to start for
the depot that was so near, with its food, its fuel,
its warmth, its companions; and each day they found
the blizzard howling about them, as effectual a barrier
as if it had been a cast-iron wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall stick it out to the end,&#8221; wrote Scott on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
the 29th, &#8220;but we are getting weaker, of course, and
the end cannot be far.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake look after our people!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they died, these heroes and gentlemen; and
through Scott&#8217;s last letters which were found with the
dead bodies in the tent on November 10 there is but one
thought running: the care of the people left behind and
the praises of the men who had accompanied him.
Never were such eulogiums written. &#8220;Gallant, noble
gentlemen,&#8221; he called them, as death brooded over him;
and throughout every line there was the spirit of cheeriness
which takes life&mdash;and death&mdash;as becomes a hero
who knows that failure was no fault of his own, that
man can do no more than fight nobly against the forces
arrayed against him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORIES OF THE LIFEBOAT</h2>


<p class="ph1">Noble Deeds of Brave Men</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE bluff and hearty men, heroes every one, who
live all around the coasts, ready to launch their
lifeboats to go to the aid of shipwrecked mariners,
have a bright page in the history of the sea. They
are the saviours of those who go down to the sea
in ships, and on every errand of mercy they literally
take their lives in their hands, place themselves on the
knees of the gods ready for sacrifice.</p>

<p>Sometimes the gods accept the sacrifice.</p>

<p>It happened so in the case of the Fethard lifeboat
which, on February 20, 1914, pushed off to the assistance
of the Norwegian schooner <i>Mexico</i>, wrecked on
the rocky island of South Keeragh. The <i>Mexico</i>, losing
her bearings when off the south coast of Ireland, was
driven into Bannow Bay, missed stays when her crew
tried to put her about, was caught by the fierce S.S.W.
gale and the strong tide, and driven close to the South
Keeragh Island.</p>

<p>On the mainland it was quickly observed that the
<i>Mexico</i> was in a dangerous position, and about 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
the lifeboat <i>Helen Blake</i> shoved off to her assistance.
The gallant lifeboatmen pulled their hardest, hoping to
reach the spot in time to help the <i>Mexico</i> before the
howling wind and the strong tide had finished the work
begun; but, though they tugged as they had never
tugged before, they were too late. The <i>Mexico</i> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
picked up like an india-rubber ball and flung against
the rock island. There was a grating sound as the hull
crashed into the rocks; the ripping of her bottom seemed
like a clap of thunder; and then the heavily laden ship,
carrying tons of mahogany logs, bumped and bumped
again upon the rocks, which held her fast.</p>

<p>The men in the lifeboat, now fifty yards away, held
their breath for a moment as they saw the disaster;
then on they went again, carried this time not of their
own free will, but by the relentless elemental forces.
A heavy breaker caught the boat, broke over her in
a mighty volume of water, and filled her up to the
thwarts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go the anchor!&#8221; was the cry; and instantly the
anchor was flung overboard. But, before it could bring
her up, three or four following seas, as though eager
to ensure destruction, caught the boat, and with
her freight of heroes, hurled her with a mighty crash
against the rocks. She smashed to pieces as though she
had been built of china.</p>

<p>Fourteen men she had carried; and in an instant
fourteen men were struggling for dear life in the midst
of a boiling sea. Pygmies fighting against the giant
forces of Nature, children beating puny hands upon
the leering face of death, striving to force the black
angel back; such were these men who, seeking to save
others, were in danger of losing themselves. And in
the titanic struggle nine men were lost.</p>

<p>Five of them won. Buffeted against the rocks,
clutching and loosing, they fought for handhold and
foothold, and at last, scrambling over the slippery
points, they managed to fight to safety.</p>

<p>Then, weary and half dead themselves, they thought
of what they had come out to do. The <i>Mexico</i> was still
bumping dangerously upon the rocks, men clinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
to rigging, or to anything near at hand, lest the waves
wash them away, or the lurching of the ship pitch them
overboard&mdash;to death. And those heroes, who had felt
the wings of the Angel of Death brush against them as
he passed by, began the task of saving the men on the
<i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<p>How they did it they never realised; but they knew
they worked hard, and one by one, by means of ropes,
they brought eight men off the wrecked ship on to
the island. It is but a bald statement of the fact that,
but with untellable heroism, indomitable determination,
and sublime indifference to death and danger behind it.</p>

<p>With no boats, no food or water except what the
<i>Mexico</i> men had managed to bring with them, and that
all-insufficient, the thirteen men found themselves
stranded on a barren island, with a raging tempest
about them and no help in sight.</p>

<p>They passed the first night in shivering despair,
huddling together to warm each other. Morning came,
and brought no signs of succour, though during the
night other lifeboatmen had sought to sally forth to
their help, but had been beaten back by the anger of
the gale.</p>

<p>The Wexford boat, <i>James Stevens</i>, and the Kilmore
boat, <i>The Sisters</i>, had swept through the darkness
towards them, their men fighting gallantly and the
boats wrestling bravely with the waves and wind;
but all to no avail. They had to put back, her
mission unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a message had been sent to the Chief
Inspector of Lifeboats in London, Commander Thomas
Holmes, R.N., who was dispatched immediately to
take charge of the operations.</p>

<p>Presently the stranded men saw through the haze
of the storm a black dot, tossing about on the bosom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
of the sea. It was the lifeboat <i>Fanny Harriet</i>, from
Dunmore East, whose gallant crew were making an
attempt to reach them. She fought bravely against the
tumult, but was driven back again and again, until
her crew, realising that it was hopeless to stay out
any longer, reluctantly put back to harbour. Then
once again, and yet again, the Kilmore boat plunged
into the sea, followed by the Wexford boat, <i>James
Stevens</i>. Yet all they could do was useless, and they
were forced to return to shore. Father Neptune was
winning.</p>

<p>When Commander Holmes arrived on the scene at
3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the Sunday he found the <i>Fanny Harriet</i> lying
in harbour at Fethard, her men eating their heads off as
they thought of their enforced idleness. Something
about the commander brought back to these heroes
the determination to succeed; and the boat was
launched again, and fought her way towards the island.
Once again, however, they were frustrated. The
ground swell prevented them from getting anywhere
near the island, and the stranded men wrung their
hands as they saw her turn about. Hungry, thirsty,
they looked forward to nothing but death. Already one
of their number, a man from the <i>Mexico</i>, had succumbed
to the exposure, and they saw in his fate the picture
of their own, unless help came soon. They covered
him up with some canvas and clods of earth.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_250.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;She fought bravely against the tumult, but was driven back again and again&#8221;</p>

<p>To the imperilled men the night of Saturday, the
21st, had been a terrible one. The gale that swept
them was the worst known on the south coast of Ireland
for many years, and the lifeboatmen, who had passed
through many terrors of the sea, knew that they stood
little chance of being taken off. For the thirteen men
there were but two small tins of preserved meat and
a few limpets. On the schooner were provisions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
plenty, but it was impossible to get into her to fetch
them off; and, with food so near, they were face to
face with hunger. Water, there was none; their drink
consisted of a little brandy and half a pint of wine,
which the <i>Mexico&#8217;s</i> captain had managed to bring with
him when leaving the vessel. The biting wind blew
down upon them, cutting them to the bone; the spray
flung up by the breaking waves drenched them, and
they had no shelter from the pouring rain. Yet the
Fethard men bore up bravely, encouraging the Norwegians
and giving them hope, for they knew that no
efforts would be spared to get them off.</p>

<p>As, one by one, they saw the lifeboats try to reach
them, only to be beaten back, not all the cheering words
of the Irishmen served to keep up the spirits of the
foreigners; and in their own hearts the Fethard men
realised the hopelessness of it all. They might stay
there until death came; for succour, it seemed, could
never come.</p>

<p>But in Fethard Commander Holmes was not idle.
When the <i>Fanny Harriet</i> came back on the Sunday
evening, he telephoned to Wexford, informing the lifeboatmen
that, on the Monday morning, another attempt
would be made, and asking them to proceed to the scene
on the chance that the weather would have moderated
sufficiently to allow of something being done. Of
course, the Wexford men said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and, all being
arranged, at six o&#8217;clock in the morning Holmes entered
the <i>Fanny Harriet</i>. She carried a Dunmore East crew,
and a Fethard man to pilot them, for the whole locality
was strewn with hidden rocks and boulders. Fortunately,
the gale had subsided somewhat, and the lifeboat
was able to approach the vicinity of the wreck. Her
men could see the stranded wretches, who waved at
them frantically, urging them onwards.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>But the ground swell breaking outside the remains
of the <i>Mexico</i> was still so heavy that it was necessary
for the lifeboat to cruise round the island before a spot
could be found whence it was possible to approach the
shore. At last the boat was anchored in a fairly good
position some hundred yards off the rocks; and the lifeboatmen
immediately attempted to effect communication
with the castaways. Rocket after rocket was fired, and
eventually they succeeded in getting a stick-rocket
ashore with a cod-line attached. By this means a
strong line was hauled in by the men, and a small
skiff which had been brought by the lifeboat was
attached to the line, and veered successfully to within
ten yards of the island. It seemed that rescue was really
at hand, and the shivering, exhausted men brightened
up. They would be saved!</p>

<p>Then their hopes were dashed to the ground. A
heavy sea caught the skiff, a great wave broke upon
her, filled her, and drove her with a crash against the
rocks, which smashed her to pieces. But one ray of
hope came to those men. A lifebuoy which was in the
skiff was washed near to the shore, and a man plunged
in, grasped it, and brought it ashore, and felt that all
was not lost.</p>

<p>Commander Holmes hailed them, and sought to get
them to trust themselves to the lifebuoy, which the
rescuers would drag through the seas with its living
burden. It was asking much, and all knew it. It
meant casting oneself upon the mercy of a tumultuous
sea, meant giving oneself up to the danger of being
flung upon rocks and boulders, to be dashed to death.
The stranded men looked at each other; no one spoke.
Then one man, the desire of life surging through him,
took up the buoy, to which the rope had been fastened,
placed himself in it, and hurled himself into the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
to be pulled into the lifeboat&mdash;safe! Another man,
seeing this, followed his example; but the others, worn
out by their experiences, preferred to wait for some
surer way to safety than that, and elected to stay on
the island.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the Wexford boat arrived
on the scene, having been towed out by her tug. It
was now a quarter past eight in the morning, and she
anchored close to the <i>Fanny Stevens</i>, but in a rather
better position; and, to the rapture of the men on the
island, she had brought with her a strong punt, which
was more suitable for the work in hand than the skiff
brought from Fethard.</p>

<p>Two men of the Wexford boat, heroes both of them,
volunteered to work the punt. They were William
Duggan and James Wickham. They got into her,
veered her down, with a rope attached to her bows, from
the <i>James Stevens</i>, and, after a fearful experience, seized
the opportunity that a &#8220;smooth&#8221; offered, and got her
close enough to the rocks to snatch two of the men.
Then, with a heave-ho! they dragged them into the
punt, which was at once hauled back to the lifeboat.</p>

<p>Then out again in the same way the two heroes
went. But this time they were not fortunate enough
to escape damage. A wave caught them, and, as though
the punt had been a toy yacht, flung her upon the rocks,
which she hit with a crash; and, when the retiring waves
dragged her back, the two men found that she had a
hole in her side. Resourceful, calm, they grabbed up
a loaf of bread and some packing, and with this stopped
up the hole that had threatened to send the boat to
the bottom; and then struck out once more for the rocks.
That time two more men were saved; and so the work
went on, Duggan and Wickham getting to shore no
less than five times, taking off two men at each attempt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
until the whole party of weary and almost frozen men
were brought to the lifeboat. Death had been in
attendance all along; but they braved it. They
stuck stubbornly to their self-appointed task, and they
succeeded.</p>

<p>It took but little time for the tug to take the lifeboats
in tow, and in due course the survivors of the tragic
wreck were landed. The end had come to one of the
most heroic episodes in the history of the lifeboat. Nay,
not the end, for there was still the work of caring for
those whom the death of the gallant men had left
behind; and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution did
all in its power to assist, while Their Majesties of Norway
contributed to the fund opened, as also did the Storthing.
And, later, the men who had worked so heroically, and
had done so well, had their efforts recognised, though
to them the greatest satisfaction was in knowing that
they had wrought well, and had snatched precious lives
from the greedy maw of the sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A still</span> more recent instance of heroic endeavour on
the part of the lifeboatmen was on the occasion of the
wreck of the hospital ship <i>Rohilla</i>. She had been taken
over by the Government for use as a hospital ship, and
on Friday, October 30, 1914, when on her way to
Dunkirk, she ran into a terrific E.S.E. gale. She had
229 people on board, including a medical staff and five
nurses, bent on doing their best for the maimed heroes
who had fought for country and honour on the battlefields
of Belgium and France.</p>

<p>The official report of the Royal Lifeboat Institution,
on which this story is founded, is a vivid and
graphic description of a tremendous calamity.</p>

<p>It was soon after four o&#8217;clock in the morning that
the <i>Rohilla</i> encountered the storm, and, though her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
captain and crew did their very utmost, she ran on to
a dangerous reef of rocks and lay at the mercy of a
furious sea. Captain Neilson, who commanded, tried
to get all the men to go forward, but those on the
poop and aft could not cross the after part, over which
giant seas were breaking. Pounded by mountainous
waves, the <i>Rohilla</i> quickly broke in halves, and many of
those on the after part of the ship were washed away
at once, and perished. As soon as she struck, signals
of distress were made, and Coxswain Thomas Langlands
was promptly called. The sea was far too heavy
to do anything until daybreak, when the No. 2 Lifeboat,
<i>John Fielden</i>, was hauled on skids under the
Spa Ladder&mdash;a gangway from the East Pier at Whitby
to the cliff&mdash;and along the rocky scaur to the scene of
the wreck. This necessitated getting the boat over a
sea-wall eight feet in height&mdash;a most formidable task.</p>

<p>In transporting the boat she was stove in in two
places. She was, nevertheless, launched, and succeeded
in reaching the wreck, which lay surrounded by a mass
of rocks. Twelve men and five women were saved and
brought ashore. The boat was then again launched,
and, after a fearful struggle with terrific seas, got to
the vessel and saved eighteen more, the heavy waves
which swept through the ship or broke over her deck
filling the lifeboat time after time. Unfortunately, the
boat soon became unfit for further service, owing to
repeated bumping on the rocks. Captain John Mil-burn,
a member of the local committee, then sent for
the Upgang lifeboat, which was, with great difficulty,
transported to the vicinity of the wreck.</p>

<p>By means of ropes the boat was lowered down the
almost precipitous cliffs, and preparations were made
for her launch, but nothing could be done in the tremendous
seas running. In the meantime the Teesmouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
motor lifeboat and the lifeboat stationed at
Scarborough had been called by telephone to the assistance
of those still on the wreck.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Whitby coastguards were firing
rockets in rapid succession, in the hope of getting lines
to the ship; but only one was secured&mdash;and this was
of no use to the shivering people who were on the
bridge, which at any moment might give way.</p>

<p>The Scarborough lifeboat, <i>Queensbury</i>, in tow of
the steam trawler <i>Morning Star</i>, started as soon as
possible. It was quite dark when they arrived, and
in the gale it was hopeless to establish communication
with the wreck. Both craft, however, remained at hand
through the night, and the endurance of the lifeboatmen
was severely tested during their long vigil. At daybreak,
finding that it was still impossible to get near
the wreck, they returned to Scarborough.</p>

<p>In view of the tremendous seas making up the river
at Teesmouth, it was decided not to dispatch the boat
until daybreak next morning. This decision was conveyed
to Whitby by telephone, and at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> next
morning the crew left Redcar for Teesmouth, accompanied
by the Tees Commissioners&#8217; tug. In crossing
the bar the lifeboat encountered tremendous seas, and,
as a result of falling into the trough of a mountainous
wave, she sprang such a serious leak that she became
disabled, and it became necessary for the tug to take
the crew on board and tow the lifeboat back to Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning the Upgang crew made a
further attempt to rescue the survivors who were
huddled together on one small portion of the wreck.
For over an hour the crew struggled manfully to reach
the wreck; but the sea and the strong current running
between the &#8220;Nab&#8221; and the wreck was too strong for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
them, and eventually the men became totally exhausted,
and had to give up their hopeless task.</p>

<p>When the unfortunate men on the wreck, who had
held on so bravely throughout the night, saw the hope
of being rescued diminishing, some of them jumped
overboard and attempted to swim ashore, and a number
of the onlookers, with heroic disregard for their own
safety, rushed into the boiling surf and succeeded in
dragging many to the shore.</p>

<p>The Whitby No. 1 Lifeboat, in tow of a steam
trawler, also got within half a mile of the wreck, but
the sea was too heavy for them to approach any nearer,
and the boat reluctantly returned to harbour.</p>

<p>It now became apparent that only a motor lifeboat
would be able to render effective help, and the Tynemouth
motor lifeboat was summoned by telegram. On
Saturday afternoon the gallant crew, under the command
of Coxswain Robert Smith, and accompanied by
Captain H. E. Burton, R.E., hon. superintendent of
the motor lifeboat, started on their perilous journey. To
reach Whitby they were obliged to travel a distance of
forty-four miles through the night and storm, unaided
by any coast lights, which were all extinguished on
account of the war. Thanks, however, to Captain
Burton&#8217;s intimate knowledge of the Yorkshire coast,
their gallant exertions met with the success which
they deserved, and at 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on Sunday morning,
November 1, the boat was skilfully brought into Whitby
Harbour.</p>

<p>Four hours later, this boat, with Lieutenant Basil
Hall, R.N., Inspector of Lifeboats for the Southern
District, on board, and the Whitby second coxswain as
pilot, left harbour for the wreck, a supply of oil being
taken to subdue the waves.</p>

<p>The rescue of those who had survived the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
ordeal for fifty hours is well described by the representative
of the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>, who witnessed the scene,
and from whose report we give the following extracts:</p>

<p>&#8220;The light was just rising over the sea at half-past
six o&#8217;clock when the boat crept out of the harbour again,
and breasted the breakers like a seabird as she headed
straight out into calmer water. The lifeboat, looking
fearfully small and frail, throbbed her way towards the
wreck. Nearer and nearer she got; and then, when
within 200 yards of the <i>Rohilla</i>, she turned seawards.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was burning flares, and from the shore a searchlight
was playing upon the group of huddling people
who had spent so many hours in darkness and the
stress of storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently, when she had passed a few fathoms
beyond and away from the wreck, she stopped dead,
and discharged over the boiling sea gallons and gallons
of oil. It seemed that the ocean must laugh at these
puny drops, yet the effect was remarkable; within a
few seconds the oil spread over the surface of the water,
and the waves appeared suddenly to be flattened down
as by a miracle. In the meantime the lifeboat turned
about, raced at full speed past the stern of the wreck,
and then turned directly towards the shore. The most
dangerous moment came when she was inside the surf
and broadside on to the waves; but, guided with
splendid skill and courage, she moved forward steadily,
and a cheer of relief went out from the shore when she
reached the lee of the wreck, immediately beneath the
crowded bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there was not a moment to be lost, for already
the effects of the oil were beginning to pass off, and
the waves were noticeably higher. Quicker than
thought a rope was let down to the lifeboat, and immediately
figures could be discerned scrambling down into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
the boat. In less than a quarter of an hour more than
forty men had been rescued. While the rest were preparing
to leave the wreck, two enormous waves swept
over the wreck and enveloped the lifeboat. Each time
the tough little craft disappeared for a moment, reappeared,
tottered, and righted herself gamely. Indeed,
not a man was lost, not a splinter broken. Closer still
she hugged the vessel&#8217;s side, till every man aboard&mdash;fifty
of them in all&mdash;had been hauled into the rescuing
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last man to leave his lost ship was the captain,
and as he slipped into the lifeboat the crew of the latter
gave a rousing cheer that was echoed again and again
by the people ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even now the lifeboat had not finished its work;
there was danger ahead. Great heads reared at her; a
tremendous sea swamped down upon her, and she
nearly capsized; but, shaking herself free, she laboured
away, making fair progress. Then another huge wave
rose at her, threatened her with destruction, was met
boldly. Struck broadside on, the lifeboat was almost
on her beam-ends. Watchers on the shore held their
breath. Would she withstand the shock? She did,
and swept gallantly forward, and at last reached the
harbour mouth.</p>

<p>What cheers went up then! Men on shore cheered
the gallant rescuers, who cheered back, while the
rescued men in the boat joined their voices with the
others. Then the boat came to the quay, and men ran
down the steps to help the saved ashore, where they were
soon taken to shelter, after having passed through a
terrible experience.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TALES OF THE SMUGGLERS</h2>


<p class="ph1">Stories of Smugglers&#8217; Ways and Smuggling Days have
always had a Fascination</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANYTHING more adventurous than the lives of the
old smugglers would be hard to find. Nowadays
a man seeks to get prohibited goods into the country
by using false bottoms to his trunks, or swathing his
legs in bandages of rich lace; and maybe a woman
smuggler cuddles to her bosom a &#8220;baby&#8221; of most
wonderful make-up&mdash;laces, tobacco, scent! But there
is little of the adventurous about that smuggling to-day,
and we have to hark back to the days when men literally
took their lives in their hands in the effort to outwit
the Government and to avoid paying the taxes.</p>

<p>The strangest thing about smuggling is that all
classes of people were engaged in it&mdash;sailors, soldiers,
fishermen, justices of the peace, and even clergymen!
When a village depended almost entirely for its trade
upon the illicit running of goods, perhaps it is not to
be wondered at that the parson had his sympathies
with his parishioners.</p>

<p>A good instance of this is to be found in the story
of the smugglers of Morwenstowe, Cornwall. A visitor
from an inland town, strolling along the beach,
stumbled upon the scene of a &#8220;landing&#8221; one evening.
The ship lying in the offing, the boats hurrying to the
beach laden with kegs of brandy, the people lining
the shore, waiting to roll the kegs away to safety, soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
made him realise what was afoot; and, being honest,
he was staggered. And being also very temperate, he
was shocked to see men knocking in the heads of kegs
and taking their fill of brandy, and becoming so far
intoxicated as to quarrel amongst themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a horrible sight! Have you no shame?&#8221;
he cried, addressing the crowd in general. &#8220;Is there no
magistrate at hand? Cannot any justice of the peace
be found in this fearful country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks be to God!&#8221; came the answer from
somewhere amongst the busy crowd. &#8220;None within
eight miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; exclaimed the visitor, &#8220;is there no
clergyman hereabout? Does no minister of the parish
live among you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, to be sure there is,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how far off does he live? Where is he?&#8221;
asked the virtuous gentleman, who next moment
received another shock.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! That&#8217;s he, sir&mdash;yonder with the lanthorn,&#8221;
was the answer that came to him; and looking in the
direction indicated, he saw a venerable-looking man,
in his parson&#8217;s clothes, holding the light while his
parishioners worked at robbing the State!</p>

<p>When smuggling began it would be hard to say,
except that one would be safe in supposing that as soon
as a thing was taxed attempts were made to slip it
into the country untaxed. As, however, it is not intended
here to try to outline the history of smuggling,
we need not worry about that, but content ourselves
with picking out here and there some of the choice
passages from the history.</p>

<p>Something historical, however, must be allowed
to intrude, because it had a great bearing upon
smuggling; and that is, that prior to 1816 there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
no systematic attempts made to prevent the illicit importation
of taxed goods. True, the Government
had excise men and revenue cutters on guard; but
they were all too few, owing chiefly to the fact that
the great wars of the eighteenth century took up most of
the men, while the general slackness tended to make
it fairly easy for the &#8220;free trader,&#8221; as he was called,
to slip into some cove and unload his illegal cargo.
Sometimes, indeed, the revenue men themselves had
lapses and &#8220;ran&#8221; goods in on their own account! In
1816, however, following the conclusion of the great
peace, the Government instituted a regular system of
smuggling prevention. Kent and Sussex having been
the favourite playground of the smugglers, the coasts
of these two counties were blockaded. A man-o&#8217;-war,
the <i>Hyperion</i>, was stationed at Newhaven, in Sussex,
and the <i>Ramilles</i> in the Downs, off Kent; and the
martello towers which had been erected along the
coasts against the coming of Napoleon&#8217;s armies were
used to house their crews. To all intents and purposes
these sailors were the first coastguards, and in due
course the system of blockading was carried out all
round the coasts of Britain, chiefly by means of the
revenue men and cutters. On these the Government
drew, and duly formed the &#8220;Preventive Water Guard,&#8221;
whose crews were stationed at certain spots along the
coasts to keep watch and ward day and night.</p>

<p>It is true that at the end of the seventeenth century
there were Riding Officers, whose work was to patrol
the south-east coast on the look-out against wood
smugglers. But as there were only about three hundred
of them, and these all civilians, they were by no means
an effective check to the smugglers. Later on they were
permitted the assistance of the dragoons, who naturally
resented being placed under the direction of civilians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
with the result that there was much friction, and the
service, instead of being improved, suffered a great
deal, the soldiery incidentally finding it a paying game
to keep in with the smugglers.</p>

<p>In 1822 changes were made, and the civilian riding
officers disappeared and their places were taken by men
from the cavalry regiments, and at the same time the
Board of Customs was given sole control of the preventive
services, which then consisted, as we have seen, of
the revenue cutters, Preventive Water Guard, and Riding
Officers. Seven years later something more was
done&mdash;the coastguard proper was born. No man was
eligible for the service unless he was between twenty
and thirty years of age and had served six years at
sea or seven years&#8217; apprenticeship in fishing-boats. The
new force justified its creation, and in a few years took
charge of the work that had been done by the revenue
men who had been detailed for the blockade system
along the east and south coasts; and then, later, the
revenue men were made liable to service on board the
men-o&#8217;-war; so that to-day the coastguard force is a
part of the Royal Navy, and has even had its taste of
active service, having been found of immense use, for
instance, in the Crimean War.</p>

<p>So much for the dry bones of history as seen in
the development of the coastguard force, which is bound
up with the story of smuggling, from which we will
now cull some instances.</p>

<p>The smuggler was honest&mdash;in some ways. For instance,
away back in the latter half of the eighteenth
century there lived a man who, named John Carter,
received the sobriquet &#8220;The King of Prussia.&#8221; Carter&#8217;s
home was at Porth Leah, in Mount&#8217;s Bay, that wonderful
place in Cornwall. To Porth Leah was later
given the name of Prussia Cove, in honour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
&#8220;honest smuggler,&#8221; who did things so thoroughly that
he erected a battery with which to keep the revenue
cutters at bay, cut a road by which he could transport
his cargoes from the harbour&mdash;which he also built;
and out of the many caves along the coast fashioned
cellars in which to store his goods. In fact, Porth
Leah was what one might call a smugglers&#8217; community.</p>

<p>The &#8220;King of Prussia&#8221; had a regular trade with
regular customers, to whom he would, like any other
trader, make definite promises of delivery; and, being
a stickler for good business, he never let anything
stand in the way of his carrying out his contracts.
One day, while he was away, the excise officers found
a cargo just arrived at Porth Leah from France. They
promptly seized the cargo and carried it off to Penzance,
and put it in the Custom House store under guard.
Thus it was that Carter, coming back, found his cargo
gone&mdash;and he had promised to deliver it to his
customers on a certain day.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here!&#8221; he exclaimed to his men. &#8220;Whaat
be I to do? I be an honest maan, and must keeap
me woord. I tell &#8217;ee, men, we be gwine to d&#8217;liver they
goods &#8217;cordin&#8217; to pledge!&#8221;</p>

<p>His men knew that when Carter felt that his reputation
as an honest man was at stake he would take
strong measures, and got themselves ready against
the coming of night. In due course they embarked on
their ship, and, armed to the teeth, as becomes men
going on a perilous errand, sailed across to Penzance.
Arrived here, they fell upon the few Customs officers
left in charge, and before they knew what had happened
the latter were prisoners and the smugglers were rifling
the stores, seeking their confiscated cargo. Not a thing
did Carter or his men take away that wasn&#8217;t their own.
They weren&#8217;t out thieving! Away they went with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
cargo to Porth Leah, where they quickly stowed it in
their cave-cellars, ready to ship again when the time
came for Carter to deliver his goods as per contract!</p>

<p>Thus, while saving his reputation the King of
Prussia added to it, for when, the next morning, the
revenue officers came to the Custom House and found
what had happened, they soon made up their minds
who had been at work:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Jack Carter,&#8221; they said. &#8220;He always was
honest, and took nothing that wasn&#8217;t his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The romantic stories of smugglers abound in incidents
connected with the caves they used for hiding
their illicit cargoes. All along the coasts may be seen
these galleried caves, and if you can get hold of the
oldest inhabitant, he will tell you tales of wonder and
danger. One oldest inhabitant of a Dorset village told
me such a story once.</p>

<p>It would seem that on a certain night a cargo was
to be run, and one by one, at this inn and the other,
men gathered to await the coming of night. When
twilight fell, men were posted at different points of the
cliff to keep a look-out for a revenue cutter, and in
the event of one coming, to endeavour to warn the
men bringing the smuggling vessel in. No cutter
appeared, and in due time&mdash;almost to the minute
arranged&mdash;the smugglers came into view. Word was
sent to the inns, and the men hurried down to the
shore, helped to pull the vessel up, and then began
the work of unloading her. Methodically, as though
each man had been trained to the work, the smugglers
set about the task, getting barrels, casks, and what not
ashore in an incredibly short time; and while one batch
did this, another hoisted the bales on their own backs
or the backs of pack-horses. Then away they went
into the night, making for their secret store-house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
This was a cave with a small entrance, barely large
enough for a man to squeeze through; but inside it
opened out into a large, roomy place with niches cut.
In these holes the goods were stored as, one by one, men
came in with them; and the work was almost done when
there came from outside the sounds which told them that
trouble was afoot. The revenue men, perhaps warned by
some gossiper of what was going on, had dashed round
a headland in their cutter and interrupted the work.</p>

<p>Before the smugglers knew what had happened the
cutter had swept into the little cove, there was a sharp
command of &#8220;In the King&#8217;s name!&#8221; followed by
roars from the smugglers, who, thus trapped, began
to think of safety. The horses that were at hand were
whipped up, men seized whatever lay near them, and
before the revenue men could land they were running
inland, keeping clear of the cave so that the Government
men should not find it. As quickly as possible
the Customs men leaped ashore, rushed after the fleeing
men, called upon them to surrender, were answered by
curses, and immediately opened fire.</p>

<p>It was the signal for a free fight. Armed, all of
them, the smugglers dropped their burdens and turned
about. Shots rang out, the pistols flashed fire, cries
of men arose; revenue men fell to the ground, smugglers
bit the dust, but it seemed that the officers must
win, when suddenly there was a rush. Under cover
of the darkness the men in the cave had slipped out,
made a detour, and then, with shouts and shots, fell
upon the revenue men, and in a few minutes had put
them to flight.</p>

<p>Then, wasting no time on the wounded officers, the
smugglers went back; some got into the boat and
slipped out with her, while the rest finished the work
of hiding the goods.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>The &#8220;run&#8221; was over, and for several weeks the
smugglers remained quiet, lest they should be traced
as having taken part in the murderous affray.</p>

<p>We have referred above to the smugglers of Kent,
and these gentry were by no means the honest kind of
folk like the Cornishmen. A typical case of Kentish
smugglers&#8217; ways is that of the Hawkhurst gang, who,
under their leader, Thomas Kingsmill, earned such a
reputation for ruffianism that a special body called the
&#8220;Goudhurst Militia&#8221; was raised to resist them, and
many a stiff fight did the two bands have. The most
disgraceful happenings in the career of the Hawkhurst
gang were those that followed the affair of the Poole
Custom House, where an illicit cargo of tea, valued at
&pound;500, had been taken into store by the officers. This
cargo had been destined for Sussex, and the Hawkhurst
gang and the Sussex men made a compact to break open
the Custom House and rescue it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on October 6, 1747, the smugglers set
out for Poole, having arranged that thirty of them were
to make the attack and thirty were to keep a look-out on
the various roads. Arriving at Poole late at night,
they sent a couple of men into the town to see if the
way was clear.</p>

<p>One of the scouts came back with information that
a large sloop lay in the harbour, in such a position that
she might easily train her guns on the door of the Custom
House and blow them to the winds if they dared to
attack. The Sussex men were scared, and, preferring
to lose the tea than their lives, turned back as if to go
away. But Kingsmill cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t do it, we&#8217;ll go and do it ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>The result was a consultation, during which another
man came from the harbour to say that the tide was
low and that the sloop could not bring her guns to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
bear on the raiders. The consultation came to an end,
and the smugglers went forward, riding down a little
back lane on the left of the town until they came to
the seashore, where they left their horses. Then on to
the Custom House, which they soon broke open, and,
taking their tea, carried it to their horses, packed it,
and rode away mightily pleased with themselves. Next
morning they arrived at Fordingbridge. Here they had
breakfast and fed their horses, going on afterwards to a
place called Brook, where they obtained a pair of steel-yards
and weighed the tea, which was then divided
amongst the men.</p>

<p>The news of the raid set the Customs folk by the
ears, and a reward was offered for the apprehension of
the raiders, but months passed by without the Government
officials being able to obtain a clue. &#8220;A striking
commentary, surely,&#8221; says Lieutenant H. N. Shore in
&#8220;Smuggling Days and Smuggling Ways,&#8221; &#8220;on the
state of merry England in the year of grace 1747! Here
was a body of thirty armed men riding into a seaport
town, storming the &#8216;King&#8217;s warehouse,&#8217; and passing
openly and undisguised the following morning with
their booty through a portion of the most civilised and
thickly populated part of England, and yet not a single
individual of the many who witnessed the passage of
the strange cavalcade, and were acquainted with many
of those composing it, could be induced to come forward
and assist the authorities in bringing the offenders to
justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eventually, however, a clue was obtained. In the
February following the raid one named Chater, a shoemaker
of Fordingbridge, was going, in company with
a Customs officer named Galley, to make a call upon
Major Batten, J.P. for Sussex. The couple arrived at
the small village of Rowland&#8217;s Castle, and put up at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
the &#8220;White Hart&#8221; for refreshment, and probably, after
dining not wisely but too well, they let slip the information
that they were bound for Major Batten. Now
there were few people in those days who were not hand
in glove with the smugglers, and the least suspicious
sign was always conveyed to the smugglers to be on
their guard. Widow Payne, who kept the inn, had
two smuggler sons, and these she at once dispatched
to give warning; and in due course men began to drop
into the &#8220;White Hart.&#8221; They chummed up with the
strangers, drank and talked with them, and at last
Chater, inveigled outside, volunteered the information
that he was on his way to swear against one of the men
who had taken part in the Poole Custom House affair.
Galley, Chater&#8217;s companion, began to wonder what was
afoot, and came outside to see; and had no sooner
shown his face out of the door than he was knocked
head over heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a King&#8217;s officer,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A King&#8217;s officer, are you?&#8221; said his assailant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
make a King&#8217;s officer of you; and for a quartern of
gin I&#8217;ll serve you so again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The smuggler&#8217;s mates gathered round, and realising
that open methods would be rash, succeeded in soothing
the irate King&#8217;s officer; and the company went back
to the inn to drink and feast. Sad to relate, Chater
and Galley got drunk, and had to be put to bed; and
when they awoke they found themselves on the back of
a horse, being carried they knew not whither, but with
men slashing at them with whips and crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whip &#8217;em, cut &#8217;em, slash &#8217;em, curse &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>The smugglers had at first made up their minds to
hide them for a while, until the commotion had blown
over, and then send them away to France; but the
smugglers&#8217; wives had considered this too mild treatment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and had called out for their death. &#8220;Hang the
dogs!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;For they came to hang us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eventually, however, gentler measures were suggested,
and it was decided that the men were to be
secreted until it was discovered what was to be done with
the smuggler who had been arrested&mdash;the man against
whom Chater was going to give evidence. Each of the
ruffians had agreed to give threepence a week towards the
keep of the two men, but, drink-maddened, they soon
forgot this, and set to work to belabour the unfortunate
men, who at last rolled under the horse&#8217;s belly, and hung
thus while the animal was driven like mad, the hoofs
striking the men&#8217;s heads as they went. Then they were
hoisted on to the horse&#8217;s back again, and the whipping
renewed until the poor fellows were a mass of bruises
and weals and too exhausted to keep on the horse&#8217;s
back. They were then untied, slung across other horses,
and carried on through the night, till the men cried out
in their agony to be shot through the head.</p>

<p>Presently unconsciousness came to their relief.
Arrived at Rake, near Liss, the smugglers drew up
at the &#8220;Red Lion,&#8221; and induced the landlord to admit
them. Here they imbibed afresh, and, drink-sodden, no
doubt, they took Galley&#8217;s body and buried it in a sand-pit&mdash;probably
while he was alive, for when the corpse
was exhumed it was found that his hands were before
his face, as though held there to protect it.</p>

<p>Chater, exhausted and running blood, was taken
to the village of Trotton and chained to a post in a turf
house, with two smugglers to guard him, and with
barely enough food to keep him alive, pending the
decision of the smugglers as to what to do with him.
Next day they spent in revelry, and at night they repaired
to the turf house, where one of them, drawing
a large clasp knife, went up to Chater and cried:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;Down on your knees and to prayers! I&#8217;ll be your
butcher!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chater, who was frightened almost to death, knelt,
and the next instant received a kick in the back.
Gasping, he asked tremblingly what had become of
Galley.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve killed him, curse you!&#8221; cried one of the
ruffians. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221; And drawing his clasp
knife, slashed it across the man&#8217;s eyes and nose, almost
cutting out both eyes and slitting the gristle of his nose!
A second slash made a terrible gash on Chater&#8217;s forehead,
and after several other barbarities the unfortunate
man was tied on a horse and carried to &#8220;Harris&#8217;s Well,&#8221;
in Lady Holt Park, where they thought to drown him.
First, however, they tried to hang him; but the rope
was too short to admit of a sufficient drop, and he hung
over the well. What did the smugglers do but cut the
rope and send him hurtling down the well head first;
and then, finding that he still lived, they pitched stones
down at him until they were absolutely certain that he
was dead!</p>

<p>A more revolting case it would be hard to conceive;
and as the smugglers took every precaution to hide
traces of their crime, they considered themselves safe.
They overlooked one thing, however. Galley&#8217;s greatcoat
had been dropped on the journey from Rowland&#8217;s
Castle, and it was found later on, bloodstained, and
sent to the Customs men, who at once knew that the
smugglers had been at work. A large reward was immediately
offered, and a free pardon promised to anyone
who would &#8220;peach&#8221;; but as the smugglers had
vowed amongst themselves not to &#8220;inform,&#8221; and had,
indeed, been terrified by one of their leaders, who swore
to kill any informer, &#8220;whether one of themselves or
anybody else,&#8221; and as even the Custom officers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
timid in face of the open threats made by the smuggling
community, it did not seem likely that the butchers
would ever be brought to justice. It may seem incredible
that such should be the case, but the picture
painted by a contemporary writer brings the facts home.
&#8220;The smugglers had reigned a long time uncontrolled,&#8221;
says this writer. &#8220;They rode in troops to fetch their
goods, and carried them off in triumph by daylight;
nay, so audacious were they grown that they were not
afraid of regular troops that were sent against them into
the country to keep them in awe.... If any one of
them happened to be taken, and the proof ever so
clear against him, no magistrate durst commit him to
jail. If he did, he was sure to have his house or barns
set on fire, or some other mischief done him, if he
was so happy as to escape with his life!&#8221;</p>

<p>But, Nemesis! What all the efforts of the King&#8217;s
officers could not accomplish an anonymous letter
brought about. This letter, written by someone who
was in the know, was sent to the authorities, and it told
them of the likely place in which Galley&#8217;s body would
be discovered. Search was made, and the body found.
A second unsigned letter gave the name of a man concerned
in the crime. This man was arrested, and, fearing
for his life, turned King&#8217;s evidence, told everything,
and the King issued a proclamation that unless they
surrendered themselves to justice at a day appointed
the smugglers would be outlawed; and a reward of
&pound;500 was promised for the apprehension of everyone
who should be convicted.</p>

<p>In the end seven of the murderers were caught and
put in prison. A special assize was held at Chichester,
January 16, 1749&mdash;nearly twelve months after the crime&mdash;and
the seven were sentenced to death, five of them
to be hung in chains as a warning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Later two more of the gang were captured and
executed, and in April of 1749 the Hawkhurst gang
came to an end, for the crimes laid to its account
roused the Government to vigorous action, the smugglers
were caught one by one, and at last Kingsmill, the
ringleader, was hanged at Tyburn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MODERN CORSAIRS</h2>


<p class="ph1">How the German Rovers were Destroyed</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE outbreak of the Great War of the Nations found
various German warships in the Atlantic and
Pacific, ready to prey upon the Allies&#8217; shipping, and
day by day the news flashed across the world of merchant
ships sunk or captured, and this despite the fact
that Great Britain, France, Russia and Japan were
scouring the seas to find the destroyers. First one and
then another of the German marauders was caught and
sent to its doom. But even then a fair number were
abroad; several of them&mdash;the <i>Dresden</i>, the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>,
<i>Leipzig</i>, <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>&mdash;were tackled by
Admiral Craddock, in command of a British squadron
of much inferior strength. The Germans won, only a
few weeks later to be trapped by Admiral Sturdee and
a strong squadron off the Falkland Islands. In the
battle that ensued the Germans lost, and the vessels
were sent to the bottom.</p>

<p>Before the battle of the Falklands took place, however,
there had been certain other events of scarcely less
importance&mdash;namely, the hunting down of the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>
and the <i>Emden</i>, the most noted of the German
corsairs. That they did fine work for their country,
even British tars will admit. They were as slippery
as eels, and turned up in the most unexpected places
and at the most inconvenient times for the British trading
vessels. But at last Nemesis overtook them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>There was the <i>Emden</i>, for instance. She was at
Tsing-tau when war broke out, and immediately started
out on her marauding cruise. Slipping out of the
harbour she steamed off for the Straits of Malacca, with
enemies hot upon her track. She hoodwinked them,
and while they were going southward, she swept into
the Bay of Bengal, sinking various vessels as she went,
and finally shelling Madras, setting fire to the oil tanks
there.</p>

<p>Thence she went to Ceylon, sending four more boats
to the bottom, making nine in all. Another she sent
into port with the crews of the sunken ships, and yet a
further one&mdash;the collier <i>Buresk</i>&mdash;she held on to for the
sake of the coal she carried. So, aided by wireless
installations in different places and by supply ships,
she kept on her destructive way, until by October 19 she
had captured half a dozen more ships.</p>

<p>Then something happened to annoy her. H.M.S.
<i>Yarmouth</i>, which had been following her doggedly,
seized some of her supply ships; and the <i>Emden</i> slipped
into hiding for a while, though trading vessels still went
in dread, expecting her to turn up suddenly.</p>

<p>She did turn up suddenly, though her quarry was
something better than merchant shipping. On October
21&mdash;Trafalgar Day&mdash;a four-funnelled cruiser swept
into Penang roadstead, and the French destroyer
<i>Mousquet</i> and the Russian light cruiser <i>Jemtchug</i> little
thought that this was the <i>Emden</i>, which they knew had
only three funnels. What had happened was that Captain
von M&uuml;ller, her commander, had rigged up a jury
funnel out of woodwork and canvas, thus altering altogether
the appearance of his ship.</p>

<p>The <i>Jemtchug</i> saluted her with &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Yarmouth!</i>&#8221; was the audacious answer. &#8220;Coming
to anchorage!&#8221; And the <i>Emden</i> immediately swung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
round stern on to the <i>Jemtchug</i>. Forthwith she loosed
one of her deadly torpedoes at the Russian, following
it up with a shower of shells from her 4-inch guns.
Down went the <i>Jemtchug</i>, the French boat going after
her almost immediately, stricken to death by the crafty
<i>Emden</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus completed the destruction of her unsuspecting
foes, the German corsair went into hiding
again, but on November 9 appeared off the Cocos Islands&mdash;to
meet her doom.</p>

<p>For the Australian cruiser <i>Sydney</i> received an interrupted
wireless message from the Cocos to the
effect: &#8220;Strange warship ... off entrance,&#8221; and at once
sped off at full steam, and at 9.15 the look-out saw the
tops of the coco-nut trees of the Keeling Islands in the
distance. Five minutes later the <i>Emden&#8217;s</i> funnels were
sighted, twelve or fifteen miles away. Game, the German
opened fire at a long range, the <i>Sydney</i> waiting
for a little while, and then sending her explosive replies.
It was a gallant fight; the <i>Emden</i> made some fine
firing practice, smashing the <i>Sydney&#8217;s</i> No. 2 starboard
gun almost immediately, and putting practically all the
crew out of action. The Australian&#8217;s aft control was
blown to pieces, and a fire broke out, which her men
soon got under while the fight raged.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Sydney</i> worked well that morning,
as the letter of one of her officers testifies:</p>

<p>&#8220;The hottest part of the action for us was the first
half-hour. We opened fire from our port guns to begin
with. I was standing just behind No. 1 port, and the
gunlayer (Atkins, First-Class Petty Officer) said: &#8216;Shall
I load, sir?&#8217; I was surprised, but deadly keen there
should be no &#8216;flap,&#8217; so said: &#8216;No, don&#8217;t load till you
get the order.&#8217; Next he said: &#8216;<i>Emden&#8217;s</i> fired, sir.&#8217; So
I said: &#8216;All right, load, but don&#8217;t bring the gun to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
ready.&#8217; I found out afterwards that the order to load
had been received by the other guns ten minutes before,
and my anti-&#8216;flap&#8217; precautions, though they did not
the slightest harm, were thrown away on Atkins, who
was as cool as a cucumber throughout the action.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the time we were going 25 and sometimes as
much as 26 knots. We had the speed on the <i>Emden</i>,
and fought as suited ourselves. We next changed
round to starboard guns, and I then found the gunlayer
of No. 1 starboard had been knocked out close
to the conning-tower, so I brought Atkins over to fire
No. 1 starboard. I was quite deaf by now, as in the
hurry there had been no thought of getting cotton-wool.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a point I won&#8217;t overlook next time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming aft the port side from the forecastle gun I
was met by a lot of men cheering and waving their
caps. I said: &#8216;What&#8217;s happened?&#8217; &#8216;She&#8217;s gone, sir,
she&#8217;s gone.&#8217; I ran to the ship&#8217;s side, and no sign of
a ship could I see. If one could have seen a dark cloud
of smoke, it would have been different. But I could
see no sign of anything. So I called out: &#8216;All hands
turn out the lifeboats, there will be men in the water.&#8217;
They were just starting to do this when someone called
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s still firing, sir,&#8217; and everyone ran back to
the guns. What had happened was a cloud of yellow
or very light-coloured smoke had obscured her from
view, so that looking in her direction one&#8217;s impression
was that she had totally disappeared. Later we turned
again and engaged her on the other broadside.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, although she was still fighting gamely, the
<i>Emden</i> was in a poor way; her three funnels and her
foremast were shot away, and she was on fire aft. To
complete the work so well begun, the <i>Sydney</i> swung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
round again, and opened on her with the starboard
guns, which sent her running ashore on North Keeling
Island. Then, having fought for an hour and forty
minutes, and realising that the <i>Emden</i> could not escape,
the <i>Sydney</i> went in chase of the German&#8217;s collier. Coming
up with her, they found that the crew had opened the
seacocks and that she was sinking rapidly. The crew
was taken off, and the <i>Sydney</i> steamed back to have a
look at the <i>Emden</i>. It was four o&#8217;clock when she
arrived, and almost immediately the Germans hauled
down their colours and hoisted a white flag; they
were surrendering. In the ordinary course the <i>Sydney</i>
would now have sent boats out on rescue work, but it
was too late in the evening to do that, especially in
view of the fact that at any moment another German
cruiser&mdash;the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>&mdash;might come into sight, when
the <i>Sydney</i> would need to be ready to tackle her. She
therefore steamed away till morning, picking up a
German sailor as she went, making the fourth they
had managed to rescue during the day.</p>

<p>Early next morning the <i>Sydney</i> looked in at the
cable station, to find that a landing party from the
<i>Emden</i> had smashed the instruments, and then stolen a
schooner and escaped.</p>

<p>A little after eleven o&#8217;clock the <i>Sydney</i> went back
to where the <i>Emden</i> had run ashore, and an officer was
sent over to her. He was helped aboard by the Germans,
and found the vessel an absolute shambles. One
hundred and eighty men were killed. Captain von
M&uuml;ller gave his parole, and the wounded were quickly
got over to the <i>Sydney</i>, where they were attended to.
The remainder of the crew were then transhipped, and
the <i>Sydney</i> sped off for Colombo, where she received a
mighty welcome, though she went in silent, for her
captain had ordered that there should be no cheering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
over the defeat of gallant foes, who had always behaved
like gentlemen to those whom they had captured.</p>

<p>When we recall that during the days of her marauding
cruise the <i>Emden</i> had captured and sunk shipping
to the value of little less than four and a half million
pounds, it will be seen that the <i>Sydney</i> had done some
very good work in bringing her career to an end.</p>

<p>The <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>, which the <i>Sydney</i> had half expected
to turn up at the Cocos Islands, met her doom
at the hands of the British light cruiser <i>Chatham</i> in
the Rufigi River, German East Africa. The <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>
had also been a danger on the seas, but she had
only succeeded in sinking one trading vessel and disabling
the obsolete cruiser <i>Pegasus</i>. The latter had
snapped at the Germans at Dar-es-Salaam in German
East Africa, and had then gone over to Zanzibar to
repair. She was, however, surprised by the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>
while her crew were hard at this work. Before
they knew what was what a hail of shells was poured
into the <i>Pegasus</i>, which shivered from the shock; her
steel work was bent and twisted, men fell dead or
wounded, and very soon the <i>Pegasus</i> men knew that
they were fighting a hopeless battle. But they fought
it as became men with the tradition of unconquerable
pluck behind them.</p>

<p>Their ensign was sent hurtling to the deck by a
lucky shot; a man seized it in his hand and held it
aloft, a sign of defiance to their overwhelming opponent.
That man died waving the flag; another snatched it
from his dead hand, and flaunted it bravely; and when
the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>, her work done, steamed away, the
British ensign still floated in the breeze above the
shattered <i>Pegasus</i>.</p>

<p>This one-sided action took place on September 19,
and just over a month later the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i> was run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
down by the <i>Chatham</i>, and her career came to an end.
The <i>Chatham</i> found her hiding in the Rufigi River,
six miles up stream. The British cruiser, owing to her
great draught, could not go up after her, and the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>
landed part of her crew, who dug themselves into
entrenchments on the Mafia island at the entrance of the
river, expecting an attempt to assault them. The
<i>Chatham</i>, however, shelled her and the entrenchments,
but the dense palm groves amid which she lay made
it impossible to tell with what effect. To ensure that
she should not escape, the <i>Chatham</i> took measures to
bottle her up; a German East African liner, the <i>Somali</i>,
was sunk in the mouth of the river, and later the s.s.
<i>Newbridge</i> was also used for this purpose. This ship
(Captain Willett) had a cargo of coal on board. She
was protected aft by sandbags and sacks of coal, and
her steering gear and engine-room were shielded by
steel sheets so that the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg&#8217;s</i> fire might not
prove too destructive as the <i>Newbridge</i> made her way
up river.</p>

<p>The men in the entrenchments on Mafia Island were
prepared for the coming of the <i>Newbridge</i>. By some
means the Germans had discovered that she was to be
sent; and as they were armed with Maxims and quick-firers,
it looked as though the collier would receive a
pretty warm reception. She did!</p>

<p>Lieutenant Lavington, in command, and Captain
Willett and two other lieutenants were the sole officers
on board, six or seven bluejackets and a few artificers
and stokers comprising the crew&mdash;a gallant company
going on a dangerous errand. As soon as the <i>Newbridge</i>
got within range the Germans on the island
began firing, without much effect. Then, having
passed the island, in spite of a perfect hail of bullets
and shrapnel, she was moored into the position decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
upon, and the last stages of the work begun.
Down in her hold were several charges of guncotton,
with an electric wire connected to the launch
that had followed the ship. Having opened her port
tank, so that the water might pour in and give the
<i>Newbridge</i> a list up stream, and make her satisfactorily
withstand the strong current running, the crew slipped
into their boats alongside, the connection was set up;
and there followed three loud explosions. The <i>Newbridge</i>
sank; and the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i> was effectually bottled up.</p>

<p>For the men who had hazarded everything on this
mission the serious task now before them was to get
back to the open sea; and to do this they had, of course,
to pass the island, with its force of Germans. They sped
back as quickly as they could, meeting a shower of shot,
which caused considerable damage; but at last the gantlet
was run and the intrepid men were safe on board.</p>

<p>Less than a week later the <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i> was sunk.
As she was hidden by the dense foliage, and had
taken the precaution of covering herself with leaves,
the British had, as we have said, much difficulty in
telling whether the shell fire was effective. In order to
get the exact position, therefore, an aeroplane, brought
by the <i>Kinfauns Castle</i>, was used. The whirr of her
engine, as she reconnoitred over them, told the Germans
that the end was very near, and they were quite prepared
for the well-placed shots which quickly followed
the dropping of smoke bombs, signalling the position
of the lurking cruiser. The great, destructive shells
smashed into her, wrought havoc all through her, broke
her as though she had been a cardboard toy; and very
soon she sank. The <i>Pegasus</i> had been avenged.</p>

<p>These two cases are typical of the way the British
Navy dealt with the modern corsairs and showed Germany
that Britannia still rules the waves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WRECKERS</h2>


<p class="ph1">Stories of Human Ghouls</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE are few things more fiendish to be found
in the story of the sea than the wholesale system
of wrecking which was in practice from early times up
to comparatively recent years. The wreckers were
nothing less than ghouls who preyed upon mariners
whom they had lured to destruction. Very severe laws
were made to deal with them, but it is to be feared
that they were very ineffective.</p>

<p>On September 11, 1773, the <i>Charming Jenny</i>, Captain
Chilcot, was battling bravely against a storm
off the Isle of Anglesea. For a while all went well,
and Chilcot thought that he could weather the storm.
Away in the distance there suddenly appeared lights
as of ships passing in the night. But, had he known
it, they were false lights&mdash;lanterns tied around horses&#8217;
necks. Scoundrelly men were leading the horses along
the cliff-heads, taking care that they were near the rocks
which poked their cruel noses above water. Chilcot,
taking these lights for those of ships passing in the
night, steered his vessel towards them, thinking he
would thereby be safe.</p>

<p>Then, when it was too late, he discovered his mistake;
there was a crunching, grinding noise as the
<i>Charming Jenny</i> hurled herself on the rocks, and in an
incredibly short time went to pieces, carrying all her
crew to destruction with the exception of Chilcot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
his wife, who were fortunate in getting on to a piece
of wreckage, and after some hours of agony and exposure
were washed ashore in an exhausted condition
and were scarcely able to move. There, on the beach,
they lay for a while, hoping for succour, instead of
which there came&mdash;the wreckers. These, when they
were satisfied that their fell work had been successful,
hurried down from the cliffs and, searching the shore,
came upon the almost lifeless bodies of the man and
woman.</p>

<p>Chilcot they seized and took away, stripped him of
his clothes, even cut the buckles from his shoes, and
then left him to shift for himself. His first thought
was for his wife, and hurrying as fast as he could to
the shore, he found her&mdash;dead. The wreckers had killed
her and carried away the bank bills and seventy guineas
she had in her pocket.</p>

<p>The significant thing about this incident was that
Chilcot, getting assistance from two kindly people near
by, put the authorities at work, with the result that three
men were arrested, and found to be well-to-do folk&mdash;one
of them, indeed, so wealthy that he could offer &pound;5,000
bail when he was arraigned at Shrewsbury Assizes!
Probably these gentry had fattened on the misfortunes
of dozens of other unfortunate mariners.</p>

<p>An incident of wrecking in Cornwall in 1838 is
typical in many respects. The wreckers in this case
were the miners of Sennen, who one day noticed a ship
trying to beat up the Channel against a fierce storm.
As it was daylight, the miners grumbled at the fate which
seemed as though it had sent a prize to taunt them,
for they could not lure the ship to destruction while
it was light. But knowing, with that instinct of the
coast-dwellers, that the storm would hold on for some
time, and that the ship could not hope to make much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
headway, they set a number of men on watch on the
cliffs to keep the ship in sight until night fell. Meanwhile
the wreckers went on with their mining. When
night fell they rushed to the coast, and soon were sent
to a particularly dangerous part. They carried a
lantern, which they set on a cliff-head.</p>

<p>To the mariners on the battling ship it seemed like
a beacon. Where they had been buffeting blindly
before, with no light to guide them, now they were
able to take bearings. The captain set his course by
the light, but, past masters in their craft, the wreckers
manipulated the light so that the skipper was deceived,
and, although he did not know it, he was gradually
getting closer and closer to the shore.</p>

<p>Crash! The ship hit the rocks, and at once realising
that he had been trapped, the skipper shouted commands;
men flew to do his bidding, but the ship refused
to budge; she was fast on the rocks.</p>

<p>Then the wreckers fell to work. There were no
fewer than two thousand of them, and while the captain
and crew were intent on getting ashore, the wreckers
busied themselves in taking out everything of value,
stripping the ship clean. The captain, knowing that
the fiends had lured him to destruction, rallied his men
together to oppose them. But what could a handful of
men do against such a horde? Although the mariners
put up a gallant fight, they were defeated and many of
them cut down.</p>

<p>Then the coastguard turned up. Again only a handful
to oppose thousands, who, in possession of a rich
prize, were determined nothing should rob them of it.
So there was another fight, fierce hand-to-hand tussles
at first, for the coastguards did not wish to kill; then,
when the wreckers began to menace their very lives,
the coastguards opened fire. This only enraged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
wreckers more, and they fell upon the officers, who
were at last driven off, unable to cope with the force
arrayed against them.</p>

<p>Then the wreckers completed their fell work.</p>

<p>In 1731&mdash;during the reign of George II., that is&mdash;there
sailed from Copenhagen a Danish East Indiaman,
the <i>Golden Lion</i>, with a valuable cargo, including twelve
large chests of silver valued at about &pound;16,000. Captain
Heitman, of the <i>Golden Lion</i>, after encountering bad
weather in the Channel and being driven northward to
the Kerry coast, at last put into the Bay of Tralee, near
the northern shore of which there lies another bay, called
the Bay of Ballyheigue, abounding with sunken rocks
and sandbanks, a place of terror to mariners.</p>

<p>How it happened is not clear, but on October 28
the <i>Golden Lion</i> entered this treacherous bay. It has
been asserted that the men of Kerry lured her by false
lights, though they vowed their innocence. In any case,
the <i>Golden Lion</i> was in a serious fix, and the only way
to save the crew was for Captain Heitman to steer his
ship ashore. This he did, and succeeded in saving the
sixty men comprising the crew, and also the &pound;16,000
of silver and various other things, though the <i>Golden
Lion</i> herself became a total wreck.</p>

<p>To the credit of the Kerry men be it said that for
a long time the Danes were hospitably treated by them;
the officers were housed at Ballyheigue House, and their
treasure was allowed to be stored in an old tower, at the
south-west corner of the court belonging to the house.
The crew were taken in to billet at various houses round
about. Meanwhile, Heitman sent news to London and
Copenhagen of his misfortune; but it would appear that
these never reached their destination, being held up in
Ballyheigue, and the Danes had to wait long, and as
patiently as they could, for news that never came.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Then there began to be a change in the attitude of
the Kerry men. Thomas Crosbie, owner of Ballyheigue
House, died, and a relative named Arthur Crosbie came
to the help of his widow and mother, executors of the
late host. Now, Arthur Crosbie was a queer customer&mdash;hard
up, crafty, always with his nose in other people&#8217;s
business. He felt that the Danes should be made to
pay something out of their hoard for all the hospitality
shown them. Heitman, nothing averse to doing so, objected,
however, to the charges put down by Crosbie&mdash;namely,
&pound;4,000&mdash;and he sent a letter of complaint&mdash;though
how it got through goodness only knows&mdash;to
Dublin. The authorities at Dublin sent back a
message that the Danes were not to be imposed upon;
and Crosbie knew that he had been foiled.</p>

<p>But only in one direction, for his crafty mind soon
set to work to devise a plan whereby he could get some
of that treasure in the vaults beneath the square tower
of Ballyheigue House; and he was not alone in his
plotting, for others of the Kerry men were of much the
same mind as he was.</p>

<p>A pretty plot was in the way of being hatched.</p>

<p>A man named Cantillon (a distant relative of the
Crosbies) started things seriously. He conferred with
David Lawlor, who kept an inn at Tralee, in April,
1732, and the result of their confab was that they paid
a visit to the farm at Beinaree belonging to the
Protestant Archdeacon of Ardfert, the Rev. Francis
Lauder, who was also a J.P. The plotters told their
scheme to one named Ryan, tithe-proctor and steward
to the archdeacon, and he eagerly threw in his lot with
them. The prize was worth it. He promised to do his
best to get other helpers, and that night he tackled John
Kevane, a labourer on the farm.</p>

<p>Now, Kevane was wary; he was not at all opposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
to the plot, but he wanted to be sure that it had substantial
backing in the shape of &#8220;the gentlemen of the
county.&#8221; Ryan was evasive on this point.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see the master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and feel
sure that the gentry will consent to it.&#8221; But Kevane
was not at all convinced, and reserved his opinion.</p>

<p>Having so far committed himself, Ryan naturally
had to follow the matter up with Kevane and get him
into the plot, lest he gave information; and next day
he tried again to persuade him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the gentry are really in it,&#8221; said Kevane at last,
&#8220;then some of them ought to appear in it, so as to
spirit up the folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t ask them to do that,&#8221; answered Ryan
craftily; &#8220;it would hardly do. But I can tell you,
Kevane, that their servants are going to help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sounded reasonable to Kevane, who therefore
agreed to enter into the conspiracy, and very soon
Cantillon, Lawlor, and Ryan found themselves with a
fairly respectable (or disreputable) following, including
William Banner, the butler, and Richard Ball, the
steward at Ballyheigue, Captain Stephen Macmahon,
and John Malony, his mate.</p>

<p>There was one other man Cantillon was anxious to
have in with him. This was Denis Cahane, a poor
smallholder at Kilgobbin, who refused at first, but at
last asked time to think it over. Thinking it over, he
felt he would like advice, and, having been told that
the gentry were in it, had a talk with his landlord,
Mr. John Carrick, a J.P. The magistrate soon put
Cahane right, and told him to have nothing to do with
the matter, and the poor chap gave his promise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it quiet, sir,&#8221; he said tremblingly, &#8220;or they&#8217;ll
kill me for an informer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cahane knew Cantillon and his roguish comrades!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>The following Sunday, May 16th, Cantillon was
coming for Cahane&#8217;s answer, and the smallholder,
worried almost to death, interviewed the Protestant vicar
in the morning, after the service at Kilgobbin. To
him he poured out his story, asking him to keep his
informant&#8217;s name secret. The vicar promised, and then
went to see Mr. Carrick, whom he asked to warn Lady
Margaret Crosbie of the plot, so that she might put the
Danes upon their guard. Carrick promised, and then
broke his word; whereupon, some days later, the vicar
himself called upon Lady Margaret and told the whole
of the tale.</p>

<p>Lady Margaret thanked him, and promised to warn
the Danes and get them to remove the chests of silver
from the vault to her house, where it would be quite
safe.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the good kind lady was in the
plot, and she did not warn the Danes. The conspirators
were able, therefore, to set about maturing their plans
which, with so many people concerned, it is not surprising
became common knowledge amongst the peasants,
rumours even reaching Tralee Custom House, whence
Heitman was advised to obtain a guard of troops from
Tralee barracks.</p>

<p>One would have thought that, in view of this information,
Heitman would have taken every precaution;
but he did not. Instead of applying for soldiers he
contented himself with asking Lady Margaret to let him
have some of the arms which had been put under lock
and key when the <i>Golden Lion</i> was wrecked; and when
his request was refused, and yet another that he might
gather all his crew into the ground floor of the square
tower, he apparently shrugged his shoulders and let the
matter slide!</p>

<p>Then Dick Ball turned traitor; he confided to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
of the Danes, John Suchdorf, that there was going to
be an attempt to steal the silver. But for sheer foolishness
these mariners want beating. Suchdorf shrugged
his shoulders, laughed all over his honest face, and told
Ball it was a really fine joke he was trying to play on
him! And he doesn&#8217;t even seem to have told the
captain, though perhaps it would have done no good
if he had.</p>

<p>It came about, then, that when the plotters considered
the time ripe everything was clear. The day
determined on was June 5, when Lady Margaret had a
few friends come to her house on a visit.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening Captain Heitman and his
officers were invited to join the party, probably to keep
them out of the way, for while the convivialities were
in progress our old friend Suchdorf noticed that three
men were prowling about the foot of the square tower;
and a little later saw Lawlor and a companion go into
Ballyheigue House. In view of what he had been told
previously, had Suchdorf been anything but a muddle-headed
man, he would have suspected what was afoot
and rushed off to Captain Heitman; but he did nothing,
said nothing, not even when, about seven o&#8217;clock, he
came upon Ball and Malony and three or four others
gathered about the tower. So the plot, which was
coming to a head, was allowed to progress unimpeded,
and soon after midnight, when everyone had retired to
rest, there was a fine hullabaloo&mdash;guns were firing, men
were shouting, women screaming, and doors being
banged, opened and shut noisily as folk awoke.</p>

<p>The work was in hand!</p>

<p>When they were sure that the people were in bed
the conspirators had rushed the tower, and, with cutlass
and pistol, had fallen upon the sentries which Heitman
always had there. There was a stiff, stern fight for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
short while, and two of the sentries fell to the ground,
dead, the third managing to get away, wounded and
bleeding, to arouse Suchdorf and his other comrades.
Suchdorf now began to realise that there <i>had</i> been
something in Ball&#8217;s story, and, jumping out of bed, he
dashed down to the door, followed by Alexander Foster,
Peter Mingard, and George Jenesen. They put up a
fine show, and succeeded in forcing the thieves out of
the tower and fastening the door; after which they
hurried upstairs and, looking out of a window, saw &#8220;a
great multitude, whose faces were blacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a fine to do; the whole countryside seemed
to be come out against them, and the four men had only
a case of arms and one gun amongst them, and only
enough powder and ball for one charge! They conferred
amongst themselves, and realising that they
could make but little resistance, and that futile, they
would be better not to make any at all, lest &#8220;it might
be the means to have them murdered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Ballyheigue House all was excitement.
Heitman, hearing the noise, and realising that
his silver was perhaps in danger after all, dashed downstairs,
to find the hall filled with the guests and other
occupants of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;My silver!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It is being stolen! Help
me to drive the thieves off!&#8221; He hurled himself at
the door, trying to pull back the bolts. Before he could
do this, however, Lady Margaret, crafty woman that she
was, threw herself in front of him, and beseeched him
not to be foolhardy!</p>

<p>&#8220;They will kill you!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Stay here!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Heitman stayed, while away over at the tower
things were moving pretty briskly. The conspirators
had forced their way in, and, working like Titans, got
all the silver-chests out, and by various means took them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
into certain places previously arranged. The holy
Lauder, archdeacon and magistrate, had considerately
lent his chaise and horses, and these bore away three
of the chests to his farm, where they were broken open
and their contents divided amongst the thieves. Six
chests were left at Ballyheigue, to be shared later; one
was carried to Tralee for the same purpose, but was
afterwards seized by the soldiers; and two others were
hidden safely at Ballygown.</p>

<p>And the Lady Margaret and her family received half
the proceeds!</p>

<p>Poor Captain Heitman! When it was too late he
called for the aid of the authorities; and although the
soldiers managed to seize the chest that was taken to
Tralee, and though Heitman offered a tenth part of
the treasure to anyone who would give information that
would lead to the recovery of the treasure, all he ever
got back was some &pound;4,000. A good part of it probably
went across the seas in Malony&#8217;s ship.</p>

<p>Justice was very tardy; after many weeks nine or
ten of the thieves were caught, though only three were
convicted. One was hanged, but a second cheated the
gallows by committing suicide; and the third was
pardoned, because Heitman thought he might turn
King&#8217;s evidence, as did some of the others who were
caught. Seeing that the &#8220;gentry&#8221; were in it, it is
not surprising that justice was tardy, and that Heitman
was kept in Ireland until the autumn of 1735, waiting
for justice and his treasure&mdash;and got neither.</p>

<p>Whether the Kerry men had lured the <i>Golden Lion</i>
to her destruction or not, there is no doubt that they
were of the family of wreckers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in 1817&mdash;on February 19, to be precise&mdash;that
the <i>Inverness</i> went ashore in the Shannon, through her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
captain mistaking Rinevaha for Carrigaholt. Everything
would have been all right, and the ship been
able to float at the next spring-tide, had not the peasants
considered it too good a chance to throw away. It was
like turning good luck away! So, banding themselves
together, they went down to the shore, boarded the
<i>Inverness</i>, and, their numbers being large and their
methods none too gentle, succeeded in scuttling the
ship and tearing away all her rigging, having taken the
precaution of sending to shore the barrels of pork and
other provisions with which the vessel was loaded. Then
they robbed the crew&mdash;even to their shirts, which they
used as bags to carry their plunder in!</p>

<p>The news spread, and next day the police appeared
on the scene, and found the peasants still hard at work
collecting their salvage. Although there were only
twelve policemen, a sergeant and the chief constable,
they pluckily threw themselves into the fray, routed the
wreckers, and stood guard over the provisions that still
remained on shore. All night they kept their vigil;
but with the coming of dawn they found themselves
surrounded by thousands of peasants. Angry at being
robbed of their prey, the wreckers had aroused the
countryside, determined to get back what they had lost.</p>

<p>They advanced in three companies, shouting threats,
waving hats, cheering&mdash;to keep their spirits up, probably&mdash;and
vowed they would have the salvage as well
as the arms of the police guard. Although they knew
they had a ticklish job in front of them, those policemen
were staunch and bold; they refused to be intimidated.
Forming into one body, they faced the three
mobs and waited for them to come on. They came on;
and there ensued a miniature battle; sticks and stones
were flung at the police, the wreckers charged down
upon them with scythes and axes, and the police replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
by firing their pistols. But it was all in vain; the mob
was overwhelming in numbers, and the chief constable
saw that they could not hold out very long. He must
have help.</p>

<p>Off went one of the policemen, a mounted man,
making for Limerick, pursued by fleet-footed men,
who, however, were soon left behind. In less than
two hours he returned with Major Warburton and a
body of twenty cavalry, with infantry behind them.
They dashed down upon the shore, to find that the
police had been compelled to retire, which they had done
in an orderly manner, and that the wreckers were once
more upon the <i>Inverness</i>, hard at it breaking it up.
Warburton and his men boarded it; a hatchet blow
narrowly missed the major, who promptly turned and
presented his pistol at the would-be murderer, and so
scared him that he flung himself overboard. But he
did not escape, for one of the soldiers charged at him
as he waded ashore and cut him down.</p>

<p>The wreckers now saw that they had brought a
hornet&#8217;s nest about their ears, and began to think of
escaping. They flew for their lives, pursued by the
soldiers, who wounded some and took many prisoners.</p>

<p>The thoroughness of the wreckers&#8217; work may be
gauged by the fact that only nine barrels of pork were
saved, and that the bowsprit, gaff, and spars of the
ship had been stolen; all her sails and rigging had been
taken away, her anchors and cables&mdash;and even her
pump!</p>

<p>An extract from an old book gives in the words of
one present a picture of another wreckers&#8217; incident:</p>

<p>&#8220;On Friday, October 27, 1811, the galliot <i>Anna
Hulk Klas Boyr</i>, Meinerty, master, from Christian
Sound, laden with deals, for Killala, was driven ashore
at a place called Porturlin, between Killala and Broadhaven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
The captain and crew providentially saved their
lives by jumping on shore on a small island or rock.
At this time the stern and quarter were stove in. The
crew remained two hours on the rock, when they were
taken off by a boat and brought to the mainland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shortly after, the captain&#8217;s trunk, with all the
sailors&#8217; clothes in general, came on shore, which the
country people immediately began to plunder, leaving
the unfortunate wreck. Then they cut away all they
could come at of the sails, rigging, etc., while hundreds
were taking away the deals to all parts of the
country. Though the captain spoke good English, and
most pitifully inquired to whom he might apply for
assistance, yet he could not hear of any for fourteen
hours, when he was told that Major Denis Bingham
was the nearest and only person he could apply to.
With much difficulty he procured a guide, and proceeded
to Mr. Bingham&#8217;s, a distance of twenty miles
through the mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime, after thirty-six hours&#8217; concealment
of this very melancholy circumstance, Captain
Morris, of the <i>Townshead</i> cruiser, who lay at Broadhaven,
a distance of about ten miles from the wreck,
heard of it, and approaching it landed with twenty men
well armed. In coming near the wreck he first fired
in the air, in order to disperse the peasantry, which
had no effect; he therefore ordered his men to fire
close, which had the desired effect, when he immediately
pursued them into the interior, from three to five miles
distance, dividing his party in different directions, when,
by great exertion and fatigue, they saved about 1,800
deals and a remnant of the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Morris had some of the robbers taken,
but, his party being so scattered, they were rescued
by a large mob of the country people.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE TRAGEDY OF A WONDER SHIP</h2>


<p class="ph1">The Story of the &#8220;Titanic&#8221; Disaster</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON Wednesday, April 10, 1912, there steamed out
of Southampton the largest boat in the world&mdash;a
wonder ship, a veritable floating palace. She was
bound for America. It was her first voyage, and it
was her last, for five days later, from out the night,
there loomed the white form of a gigantic iceberg, which
crashed into her starboard side; and the <i>Titanic</i> and
most of the people aboard her had entered upon their
last two hours of life.</p>

<p>There is a magic in figures, but even those which
tell of the size of the giant ship fail to carry the tale
of her greatness. Still, they must be given in order
to show how this mammoth of the ocean was as a pygmy
in the grip of the elemental forces.</p>

<p>She was a three-screw vessel of 46,328 tons gross
and 21,831 tons net. Her length was 852 feet, and her
breadth 92 feet. From top of keel to top of beam she
was 64 feet, while her hold was almost 60 feet deep. Her
horsepower was 50,000. She was pronounced unsinkable,
having fifteen water-tight bulkheads and a water-tight
inner bottom, extending nearly the whole breadth
of the vessel, and several other water-tight divisions.
She was fitted with six independent sets of boilers,
wireless telegraphy, submarine signalling, electric
lights and power systems; telephones and telegraphs
communicated between the various working positions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
three electric elevators were installed to carry passengers
from one deck to another; and every appliance necessary
to enable the ship&#8217;s officers to ascertain depth of
water, speed of the vessel, and a hundred and one other
things, were provided, while life-saving appliances to
the requirements of the Board of Trade were included
in her equipment. There were concert-rooms, smoking-rooms,
swimming baths, tennis courts, restaurant,
libraries&mdash;everything in the way of modern luxury.</p>

<p>And yet when the crash came to this floating palace,
this realisation of the shipwright&#8217;s dreams, out of the
2,201 souls she carried, only 711 were saved&mdash;a tragic
comment upon the impotence of man against the forces
of Nature.</p>

<p>The <i>Titanic</i> sailed from Southampton to Cherbourg,
from Cherbourg to Queenstown, then across the Atlantic
by the then accepted outward-bound route for New
York, her passengers amazed at the luxury of the
wonder ship which was bearing them to the New
World. The first two or three days were uneventful,
and on the 14th the magnificent lounge was turned into
a scene of fairy delight for a gala dinner. Beautiful
music filled the lounge and filtered through to other
parts of the ship; well dressed men and women sat and
talked, or strolled about after dinner in the <i>camaraderie</i>
of fellow-voyagers, all unsuspecting of the catastrophe
that was hastening down upon them from out the darkness
of the night.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day a wireless message had been
received from s.s. <i>Caronia</i>, informing Captain Smith
that &#8220;West-bound steamers report bergs, growlers, and
field ice in 42&deg; N. from 49&deg; W., April 12,&#8221; the <i>Titanic</i>
then being about latitude 43&deg; 35&#8242; N. and longitude
43&deg; 50&#8242; W. This was at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and at 1.42 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when
the vessel was about 42&deg; 35&#8242; N., 45&deg; 50&#8242; W., another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
wireless message was received, this time from s.s. <i>Baltic</i>,
saying that &#8220;large quantities of field ice&#8221; had been
seen that day in 41&deg; 51&#8242; N., longitude 49&deg; 52&#8242; W.</p>

<p>In order to understand the significance of all these
warnings, flashed across the ether, it is necessary to
remember the following facts:</p>

<p>Icebergs are gigantic masses of Polar glacier carried
out to sea, only about one-eighth of their mass being
above the surface.</p>

<p>Growlers are small icebergs.</p>

<p>Field ice is frozen sea-water floating in a looser form
than pack ice, covering large areas of the Polar seas,
broken up into large pieces, driven together by current
and wind, thus forming an almost continuous sheet of
ice.</p>

<p>All these forms of ice masses are dangerous to shipping,
and the ocean routes were mapped out so that
vessels might be able to steer clear of them. As a matter
of fact, although icebergs and field ice had been seen
as far south before, it was many years since field ice had
been observed so far south as at the time of the <i>Titanic</i>
disaster. Two further messages were received on the
ship during the day, one of them giving news of large
icebergs; but, except for the officers and men whose
watch it was, everybody on board the <i>Titanic</i> turned
into bed, to dream of wonderful things, no doubt, and
to wake up to a nightmare of horror.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stillness of the vast vessel was broken
by a thudding crash, a ripping of steel plates. Something
had happened. Some heard the sound&mdash;those in
the steerage, who were near that portion of the ship
which was a city, and those officers who were on deck
and the bridge. The rest, asleep, lulled into the land
of dreams by the motion of the ship, were awakened by
the strange feeling of stillness that suddenly pervaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
everything; there was no longer the throb of the engines;
the vibration of the ship ceased, and people were roused
by the utter emptiness of things, as it seemed. Heads
popped out of cabins and state-rooms, people strolled
up corridors asking each other &#8220;Why?&#8221; and &#8220;What?&#8221;
and so forth; and getting no answer that meant anything
except assurances that all was well&mdash;all must be
well! Was not this the safest vessel in the world? And
so they went back to bed.</p>

<p>But other people, those whose duty it was to keep
awake, to have their fingers upon the pulse, as it were,
of this leviathan, did not sleep. First Officer Murdoch
and his watch were on the bridge; the captain was in
his room. Murdoch, peering through the blue-blackness
of night, had seen a haze before the ship, and, quick
to realise what was before them, he issued sharp commands,
which were obeyed instantly; but all too late.
That haze resolved itself into ice&mdash;a massive, towering
mountain of ice&mdash;into which the <i>Titanic&#8217;s</i> bows cut their
way. The ice that the ether waves had been telling
about all day had loomed out upon them like a spectre
in the night; nay, like the impersonation of Death.</p>

<p>Captain Smith rushed to the bridge when he felt the
ship stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have struck ice, sir,&#8221; was the first officer&#8217;s
reply to his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Close the water-tight doors!&#8221; was the captain&#8217;s
order, only to be told that this had already been done.
A movement of switches, and Murdoch had set bells
a-tingling and great steel doors a-sliding in their
grooves; bells to warn anyone that the doors were being
closed, so that they might not be cut off.</p>

<p>But no closing of water-tight doors was to be sufficient
to save this giant ship. The damage wrought by
that white, translucent mass ran over a length of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
three hundred feet, and it had all been done in&mdash;one
trembles to write it&mdash;<i>ten seconds</i>. Twenty knots an
hour had the vessel been travelling, and in ten seconds
she had ripped her way along the ice for three hundred
feet, tearing her plates apart as though they had been
brown paper, and letting the water in in tons.</p>

<p>The carpenter sounded the ship; Phillips, the
Marconi operator, was instructed to get ready to send
out a call for assistance, in case it was wanted. The
carpenter made his report; and, because of its character,
Captain Smith went back to the Marconi room,
and messages were sent out to all steamers within reach.
Still later, but only by a few minutes, the C Q D and
the S O S&mdash;international signals for help&mdash;were dispatched,
to be followed by:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have struck a berg! Come at once!&#8221;
Seventy-eight miles away that message was picked up
by the <i>Carpathia</i>, which answered: &#8220;Coming at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, meanwhile, what of the population of the
floating palace whose vitals were being swamped by
hundreds of tons of water? She was listing heavily to
starboard. In various parts of the ship a few people
were still awake, asking what was afoot, for none had
yet been told what had taken place. If there is one
thing the master of a vessel dreads it is panic, and
passengers must be kept in ignorance while there is
a chance to obviate the danger. But rumours floated
here and there. &#8220;We&#8217;ve struck an iceberg,&#8221; said one
now and again; and, as if that were nothing to be
alarmed about, folks shrugged their shoulders and
turned into bed. So sure was everyone of the safety
of this masterpiece of science and industry that the
thought of danger never entered their heads.</p>

<p>It was a fine joke, apparently, to have struck an
iceberg, and a berg was a rare sight to most of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
people, who thought more of that than of the ship.
The great spectral mass was a thing of wonder; its
towering peak told them something of its gigantic size,
since but one-eighth of it showed above the surface.
&#8220;What a corker!&#8221; said someone, and then went to
bed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, firemen were coming up from below;
and each set who came up reported that the water was
pouring into their stokeholds.</p>

<p>Captain Smith, convinced by the list of the ship
that there was indeed grave danger&mdash;she was very much
down by the head, and diving now and again at the
rate of six or twelve inches&mdash;gave instructions that the
passengers should be gathered on the boat-decks; and
the inhabitants of the &#8220;safest ship in the world&#8221; received
the command that could have but one meaning,
namely, that the vessel was in danger of going down.
Through miles of corridors and companion-ways
stewards raced with the news, rousing folk from the
sleep of peace to the nightmare of reality, yet careful,
every one of them, not to cause panic. Reassuring,
optimistic, with unquenchable faith in the unsinkableness
of the boat, they told the passengers who asked
questions that they thought everything would be all
right.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Board of Trade regulations say that in times
of danger the passengers must put on lifebelts,&#8221; said
one steward; &#8220;and even if the boat should sink, she
will be able to keep up for forty-eight hours at least.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_300.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Men, strong-limbed, full-blooded, with the zest and the love of life in them,
stood calmly by&#8221;</p>

<p>Those words are a picture of the attitude of wellnigh
everybody on the <i>Titanic</i>, which was, as a matter of
fact, within the last minutes of her life; but, obeying
the call, they trooped up in their scores and hundreds
to the decks. Some grumbled at being brought from
warm beds to a cold, ice-strewn deck; others grumbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
at the stringency of the British Board of Trade. Imagine
the scene, if you can: long lines of stewards
guarding the boats; a mighty crowd of men, women,
and children, some dressed, others half dressed, more
with only a blanket thrown about their night-clothes,
dozens of them struggling into lifebelts. Many were
now anxious-eyed as, inexperienced as they were, they
saw that awful list to starboard, saw the tense looks on
the faces of some of the officers who <i>knew</i>.</p>

<p>The women and children, now mustered on the boat-deck,
were waiting while the lifeboats and collapsible
boats were got ready, for the tragic cry of the sea,
&#8220;Women and children first!&#8221; had rung out; and men,
strong-limbed, full-blooded, with the zest and the love
of life in them, stood calmly by and smoked while this
was done, telling themselves even now that the boat
could not sink.</p>

<p>Boat crews were shipped; and then the craft were
swung out, though not without trouble, seeing that,
being new, the tackle was not easy to work; and the
women and children, ill-clad to withstand the rigours
of that bitter night, were helped into the boats and
lowered away, out of the floating palace they had
thought so safe into a wide expanse of sea, with all its
possible dangers. Some women, indeed, refused to
leave the ship; they would not go without their
husbands, pleaded that they be allowed to come. Like
heroes, the men refused to go, and so husbands and
wives stayed on the ship of death.</p>

<p>While the work of embarking these helpless people
was proceeding officers stood ready with revolvers, lest
the passion for life seize the men and send them rushing
towards the boats. There was only one rush; some
poor steerage passengers, foreigners, who had been near
enough to the point of impact with the iceberg to realise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the terror of it all, charged down upon one boat. An
officer stopped them with a couple of shots, and strong
hands pulled them back. Their places were taken in
the boat by their wives and children, for, in this time
of disaster, social distinctions were forgotten, cast aside
like the trappings of life that they are, and rich women
and poor, ragged and well dressed, old and young,
were herded together in the same boat&mdash;companions in
distress. The rich man&#8217;s child was cuddled to some
poor woman&#8217;s bosom; the offspring of some &#8220;down
and out&#8221; nestled in the arms of a bejewelled dame of
high society.</p>

<p>The work went on, the heartrending scene in this
tragedy of the sea was played through to the accompaniment
of the noise of escaping steam, the sobbing
of wives and children as they said farewell to husbands
and fathers, and the peculiar noise that a crowd makes
in circumstances of stress; while from various parts of
the ship there were the sounds of rockets being fired,
brilliant appeals for help which cast strange lights
round and about the doomed vessel. And more, this
drama had its own music; floating up from below came
the sounds of piano and orchestra playing lively tunes,
which cheered the leaving women and the staying men,
who cried to each other: &#8220;Au revoir! We&#8217;ll meet in
New York!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down, down, down, seventy feet or more the boats
were lowered, some having to pass the exhaust of the
condensers, and running the risk of being swamped.
An incident connected with one of these boats is worth
mentioning. It was described by Mr. Beezley, a schoolmaster,
who was in her as helper. There were no
officers on board to help them work the boat, and no
petty officer or member of the crew to take charge; and
when it was seen that the boat was in danger of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
swamped by the water from the exhaust, one of the
stokers cried: &#8220;Someone find the pin which releases
the boat from the ropes and pull it up!&#8221; No one knew
where it was. &#8220;We felt,&#8221; said Mr. Beezley, &#8220;as well
as we could on the floor and along the sides, but found
nothing. It was difficult to move among so many
people. We had sixty or seventy on board. Down we
went, and presently we were floating with our ropes
still holding us, and the stream of water from the exhaust
washing us away from the side of the vessel, while
the swell of the sea urged us back against the side
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The result of all these forces was that we were
carried parallel to the ship&#8217;s side, and directly under
Boat 14, which had filled rapidly, and was coming
down on us in a way that threatened to submerge our
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop lowering 14!&#8217; our crew shouted; and the
crew of No. 14, now only twenty feet above, cried out
the same. The distance to the top, however, was some
seventy feet, and the creaking of the pulleys must have
deadened all sound to those above, for down she came,
fifteen feet, ten feet, five feet, and a stoker and I reached
up and touched the bottom of the swinging boat above
our heads. The next drop would have brought her on
our heads. Just before she dropped another stoker
sprang to the ropes with open knife in hand. &#8216;One,&#8217;
I heard him say; and then &#8216;Two,&#8217; as the knife cut
through the pulley ropes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost immediately the exhaust stream carried the
boat clear, and the other boat slipped into the water,
on exactly the same spot that the first one had occupied.
It was indeed a narrow shave, for the two boats
almost rubbed gunwales.</p>

<p>Leaving the boats as they are being got away, let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
us go to some other part of the ship to see what is
happening.</p>

<p>Down below, in the engine-room and stokeholds,
begrimed heroes were working hard at their duty. The
black squad always occupies the most dangerous place
in a ship at such times; and to the credit of these men,
who are hidden from the gaze of the people who stroll
leisurely about decks, or while away the hours in
concert room or card room, let it be said that they rarely
fail in the moment of danger. On the <i>Titanic</i>, those
men whose engine-rooms and stokeholds had not been
flooded, and who knew they would be wanted, stayed
below; the engines in the principal engine-room, which
was still protected by its bulkhead, must be run to keep
the pumps working and the dynamos running which
supplied the electricity for light and the wireless. If
the pumps could be kept going, then the vessel could
float long enough for help to come; if the wireless could
be kept working, then help could be appealed for across
the ether waves; and while the men below strove, some
at drawing fires to prevent explosions, others at stoking
fires that were safe, up in the Marconi cabin two men
were sticking to their posts. The men, Phillips and
Bride, were heroes, and their names will be remembered
while men remember the story of the <i>Titanic</i>.</p>

<p>They had sent out the first messages for assistance&mdash;SOS,
the new call for ships at sea, changing it occasionally
to CQD, the old signal. Then, when things
grew more serious than ever, and the news was brought
down to them, the instruments began to buzz out longer
messages, that told ships scores of miles away what had
happened, and what was happening. And now and
again there came a voice from the ether through the
apparatus on the operators&#8217; heads, telling them that
the signals had been caught, and that this ship and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
ship was coming at full speed. From seventy miles
away the <i>Carpathia&#8217;s</i> operator sent such a message; from
300 miles away the <i>Olympic</i> also sent her message
saying that she was coming. And thus it went on,
this long-distance conversation on which so much depended,
and which might stop at any moment, for the
captain had told Phillips and Bride that the dynamos
might not be able to hold out very long. It was the last
quarter of an hour, and Phillips, forgetting all about
himself, refusing to think of escape, stood to his work,
tapping out the messages, urging the rushing ships to
put on every ounce of steam. And Bride, no less a hero,
bethought him of Phillips&#8217;s safety. He went and got
their lifebelts, put one on Phillips and one on himself.</p>

<p>Captain Smith looked in just then, and said: &#8220;Men,
you have done your full duty; you can do no more!
Abandon your cabin now. It is every man for himself.
Look out for yourselves. I release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Phillips clung on,&#8221; said Bride, &#8220;sending,
sending. He clung on for about ten minutes after the
captain released him. The water was then coming into
our cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hero? Every inch a hero and a man! But what
of another man? The one who, creeping silently into
that cabin, where a man stood hazarding his life,
juggling with death, lest haply he might do some good
for that helpless crowd above, tried to slip the lifebelt
from the hero&#8217;s back? What of that man? He had
had a lifebelt himself, but, too scared to fetch it, had
thought of an easier way. Bride, catching him in the
act, had a desire for blood. &#8220;I suddenly felt a passion
not to let that man die a decent sailor&#8217;s death,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I wished he might have stretched a rope or walked a
plank. I did my duty. I hope I finished him; but I
do not know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Phillips went down with the ship he had tried to
save. Bride, more fortunate, came through alive, as will
be seen. He reached the deck just as the end came.
The last boat had gone&mdash;and there remained on the
ship some fifteen hundred souls, hundreds of them clinging
now in terror to each other. The gay tunes of the
orchestra changed to the solemn strains of a hymn.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the starboard was sinking,
dipping deeper and deeper, the stern rising
higher and higher, hundreds of people being clustered
there, waiting for they dared not think what. The
full terror of it all was now beginning to sink into
minds that had refused to accept the possibility of
disaster. The water lapped up higher and higher, and
men scrambled up the sloping deck, seeking to outrace
the water, which soon covered the bridge and carried
the captain away from the ship, holding in his arm
some poor, lonely babe who had been forgotten in the
hurly-burly. &#8220;Boys!&#8221; he had cried lustily ere he went,
unwillingly, for he would have stayed by his boat but
for that wave that washed him overboard. &#8220;Boys, you
can do no more! Look-out for yourselves!&#8221; And
men prepared to cast themselves into the sea, realising
now that there was no hope to be found in this ship
on which so many hopes had been set. But, instead of
jumping, they now found themselves compelled to hang
on like grim death to anything that was at hand&mdash;rails,
stanchions, deck-houses, ropes&mdash;to save themselves from
being washed away, for the stern was now towering
high above the water, and the deck seemed like a sheer
precipice, down which one might slip&mdash;to death.</p>

<p>Imagine the sight. A massive hulk, gleaming with
a thousand lights, belching forth showers of sparks
from a solitary funnel; a crowd of clinging figures; a
crowd of figures, unable to cling, sliding down that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
steel road to death. Imagine the sounds. Hear the
thud and the crash of the engines as, overbalanced,
they tore themselves from their beds and hurled themselves
across the ship, to pound against the steel sides
and burst them with a deadening explosion; hear the
horrific cracks as the decks bend; hear, from under
water, a mighty explosion, followed quickly by another
and another; hear the roar as the fire-spouting funnel
tumbles into the sea; hear, above all, the cry torn from
a thousand throats as the people on the stern of the
boat felt the last tremors, the death-struggles of the
leviathan! Imagine this sight and these sounds, and
if you have the imagination of a Poe you will not have
glimpsed a hundredth part of the terrors of that last
two minutes of the life of the <i>Titanic</i>.</p>

<p>And the next minute there was no <i>Titanic</i> afloat;
but the sea was dotted about with hundreds of black
dots, each dot a soul struggling for life, each striving
to reach something that might be floating near it&mdash;deck-chairs,
gratings, wreckage of all sorts, and every
little bit worth its weight in gold to him who might
be so fortunate as to get it. To follow all these people
in their efforts for life is, of course, impossible. And
there is no need, for each was but a picture of the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Lightoller, the second officer, had a remarkable
experience. As the ship took her final plunge he had
dived, to be drawn down against the grating that
covered the blower of the exhaust. An explosion hurled
him up to the surface again, where, having barely filled
his lungs, he was sucked down again, and drawn to
the side of the sinking ship, near the funnel draught
pipes. Yet once more was he blown upwards by the
force of a terrific explosion, and when he came to the
surface he found himself near a collapsible boat;
Lightoller clung to this, to which Bride himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
half a dozen other people were also hanging. It was
capsized; but it provided some sort of refuge.</p>

<p>The gallant captain, who had gone overboard with
the baby in his arms, fought his way through the
swimming crowd, making for one of the boats which
were still in the vicinity, hoping to effect some rescues.
He went, not to save himself, but the child. He reached
the boat, cried &#8220;Take the child,&#8221; handed it up to the
willing hands outstretched for it, and then, refusing to
be taken into the boat, cried &#8220;Let me go!&#8221; and swam
back to where the ship had disappeared.</p>

<p>There were many acts of heroism in that dreadful
sea. A man swam up to the capsized lifeboat, now
overladen. &#8220;Will it hold another?&#8221; he asked. Those
men on the boat knew, positively, that if one more man
were on her, she would pitch them all off, and they said
so, not jealously, not selfishly. And as unselfishly, the
man who wanted to live cried: &#8220;All right! Good-bye!
God bless you all!&#8221; And turned away, only to sink
almost immediately.</p>

<p>Another man, clinging to a crate, heard someone
ask: &#8220;Will it hold another?&#8221; He did not know;
all he knew was that here was a man who loved life as
he himself loved it; and the crate might offer a chance.
&#8220;Try it!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;we&#8217;ll live or die together!&#8221;</p>

<p>The story of the great disaster is told, and yet there
are some things which cannot be recounted&mdash;horrors,
endings and partings. Into the Great Unknown many
hundreds had gone. Fewer hundreds were saved by
those giant ships rushing to their aid, brought by the
call out of the vast silences of the night.</p>

<p>The appalling horror of it all staggered the world;
but the great fact stood out that Man the Ingenious
is no match for Nature the Mighty!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MYSTERIES OF THE SEA</h2>


<p class="ph1">Strange Disappearances of Ships at Sea</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is only to be expected that the sea, with all its
glory and wonders, its tragedies and its romances,
should have its mysteries too. Some of them have
been cleared up; others remain unsolved to this day,
despite all the ingenious attempts at explanation that
have been made. Some of them go back to the distant
past, such as the <i>Gloriana</i> mystery. She was a British
brig, and in 1775 the captain of a Greenland whaler
ran across her amidst the ice-fields at 77 degrees north
latitude. She was a weird spectacle as she picked
her way through a narrow channel between two great
icebergs, which seemed to be closing in to crush her,
with no one making an attempt to steer her safely
through the danger. The Greenlander looked in amazement.
The <i>Gloriana&#8217;s</i> sails were torn to shreds and
frozen hard, her rigging was a tangled mass that had
not been trimmed for Heaven knew how long; on her
decks great mountains of snow were reared, and her
sides glistened with ice; she was a spectral ship of
the icy seas, a sight to strike fear into the heart of
any superstitious sailor. For a while the captain of
the whaler did not know what to do; the strange
spectacle awed him; but clearly it was his duty to
look into the matter, and at last, summoning up
courage, he lowered a boat and rowed over to the
<i>Gloriana</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>If he had been amazed before, he was staggered
now. Clambering up the ice-cold side, he glanced in
at a porthole and saw a man sitting at the cabin table,
holding a pen as though about to write in the log-book
that lay open before him. But there was no sign of
life about the man. He was stiff, cold, dead! The
Greenlander, stiffening himself up to the task before
him, got aboard, walked gingerly, awesomely into the
cabin and found himself standing by the side of a
dead man, frozen hard. Peering over the dead man&#8217;s
shoulder, he found that the last entry in the log was
dated Nov. 11, 1762&mdash;thirteen long years before!
What had happened? How came it that this man
sitting in his cabin, writing, had met death so suddenly
that he could not finish entering his log? The Greenlander
could not say; no one could ever tell; and the
mystery was made no clearer when it was found that
there were several other dead bodies about, one of
them being a woman. And not one showed any sign
that would lead to the solution of the mystery of how
they had met their death.</p>

<p>Then take the <i>Marie Celeste</i>, which, leaving New
York on Nov. 7, 1872, with a cargo of petroleum and
alcohol, was met a month later off the Azores by the
brig <i>Dei Gratia</i>. Hailing her, the captain of the latter
ship received no answer, and something arousing his
curiosity, he went aboard&mdash;to find not a soul on her.
To heighten the mystery, there were no evidences of
mutiny, panic or disorder of any kind; the log showed
nothing that could have caused the desertion of the
ship, the last entry being dated ten days before the
<i>Dei Gratia</i> came up with her. One boat was missing,
and that alone showed how the crew, five men, and
the captain and his wife and child had gone. All the
gear was in order, her rigging being properly made fast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
her companion-ways were open. Down in the cabin a
little organ had open music lying in front of it, a sewing-machine
had a piece of unfinished work in it, the men&#8217;s
chests in the fo&#8217;c&#8217;sle were unopened and not ransacked,
the captain&#8217;s dinner was half cooked in the galley.</p>

<p>And all was silent. Though a score or more
theories have been advanced, no one has yet cleared
up the mystery of what tragic happening had taken
place on the <i>Marie Celeste</i> to make her crew desert her.</p>

<p>These mysteries of the sea are not all of an early
date; even recent years have them on record. Thus in
1910 the <i>Inverness-shire</i>, which left Hamburg in March,
bound for Saint Rosalia, in California, was met off
the Falkland Islands in June by the Italian steamer
<i>Verina</i>, with no living being aboard except a few cats.
She, too, was in perfect order so far as arrangement
went. Food was in a pot on the galley fire, an open
copy of the &#8220;Ancient Mariner&#8221; lay on the captain&#8217;s
table, as though he had been interrupted in his reading
of the weird tale of the sea. Perhaps he could tell a
weirder one than that. The sails were set, the deck
shipshape, the cargo intact, and from the pack of cards
which lay scattered about the mess-room table it would
seem that the crew had been disturbed in a quiet
game. And the explanation of it all? It was said
that the crew, thirty of them, had become obsessed
with the idea that the ship was unlucky; they broke
out into mutiny, refused to obey orders, and the ship
was deserted. In due course the <i>Verina</i> towed her into
Port Stanley, where, of course, she received her share
in the salvage.</p>

<p>In 1913 the tank steamer <i>Roumanian</i> came across
a ship which was acting so queerly that the captain
decided to investigate. It was ten days out from Port
Arthur. The strange ship was a sailing vessel, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
though some of her sails were set, they answered no
useful purpose, for she was buffeted about at the will
of the fickle winds. It took the <i>Roumanian</i> an hour
or two to catch up with the erratic ship, and when
she did so her captain boarded and found that she
was the <i>Remittent</i>, a Norwegian barque. She was
crewless, and the explanation of her queer actions was
that the rudder was unlashed and was banging about
as the vessel swung to the waves. There was nothing
missing; her papers were all intact, her cargo was
there, her water was fresh, her provisions plenty; and
yet there wasn&#8217;t a man aboard, and no indication as
to why there wasn&#8217;t. And all her lifeboats swung
at the davits. Inquiries later showed that the <i>Remittent</i>
had left Rio Grande do Sul on Oct. 25, 1912, with a
captain and a crew of six men. The <i>Roumanian</i> towed
her for many days, and then, a gale breaking upon
them, had to cast her adrift, a danger to all shipping.</p>

<p>It is this aspect of the unmanned ship that makes
her a thing to be disposed of. Whether derelict or simply
deserted, she is a menace to other ships; she may
loom out of the darkest night and crash into another
vessel, to the danger of all aboard. On the other
hand, she may voyage for months&mdash;nay, years&mdash;and
never come into collision. For instance, the <i>Fannie E.
Woolsten</i>, an American ship, was wrecked in 1891 off
the United States coast, whence her battered hulk
drifted across the Atlantic, passed down the coasts
of Europe, and then swung out across the Atlantic
again, going ashore a hundred or so miles north of
the place where she had been wrecked, having covered
10,000 miles in her strange cruise.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
